  abstract = {Bayesian Optimization (BO) has shown great promise for the global optimization of functions that are expensive to evaluate, but despite many successes, standard approaches can struggle in high dimensions. To improve the performance of BO, prior work suggested incorporating gradient information into a Gaussian process surrogate of the objective, giving rise to kernel matrices of size \$nd\$ \{\textbackslash texttimes\} \$nd\$ for \$n\$ observations in \$d\$ dimensions. Na{\"\i}vely multiplying with (resp. inverting) these matrices requires \$O(n\^2d\^2)\$ (resp. \$O(n\^3d\^3)\$) operations, which becomes infeasible for moderate dimensions and sample sizes. Here, we observe that a wide range of kernels gives rise to structured matrices, enabling an exact \$O(n\^2d)\$ matrix-vector multiply for gradient observations and \$O(n\^2d\^2)\$ for Hessian observations. Beyond canonical kernel classes, we derive a programmatic approach to leveraging this type of structure for transformations and combinations of the discussed kernel classes, which constitutes a structure-aware automatic differentiation algorithm. Our methods apply to virtually all canonical kernels and automatically extend to complex kernels, like the neural network, radial basis function network, and spectral mixture kernels without any additional derivations, enabling flexible, problem-dependent modeling while scaling first-order BO to high \$d\$.},

The general principles are formulated for systems with both bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom, allowing both commutative and anticommutative (Grassmann) cluster amplitudes.

  abstract = {The exp S formalism for the ground state of a many-body system is derived from a variational principle. An energy functional is constructed using certain n-body linked-cluster amplitudes with respect to which the functional is required to be stationary. By using two different sets of amplitudes one either recovers the normal exp S method or obtains a new scheme called the extended exp S method. The same functional can be used also to obtain the average values of any operators as well as the linear response to static perturbations. The theory is extended to treat dynamical phenomena by introducing time dependence to the cluster amplitudes. This allows the calculation of both nonlinear dynamical behaviour and of dynamical linear response and Green's functions. Practical approximation schemes are considered. In a SUB n approximation the m-body amplitudes are restricted to the order m {$\lessdot$} n and the energy functional is a finite-order multinomial in the amplitudes to be variationally determined. It is shown that the solution corresponds to summing well-defined subsets of Goldstone diagrams. These subsets are conveniently specificed in terms of tree structures, the normal or extended generalized time ordering g.t.o. trees. The extended exp S method is in the SUB n approximation able to sum, in addition to the normal SUB n diagrams, a set which contains m-body cluster amplitudes of arbitrarily high order (m {$>$} n) in the ordinary sense. The article also discusses how the SUB n truncation schemes must be modified to be able to treat a system with a strong repulsive core in the two-body interaction. The method is formulated for the general cases of Bose and Fermi systems which may or may not conserve total particle number. It is shown that the simplest approximation, SUB 1, in the extended exp S method agrees with the mean field theory, which is the coherent-state approximation in the boson case or the Hartree-Fock approximation in the fermion case. It is argued that the extended exp S method already in low-order approximations can realistically treat a great variety of diverse many-body problems, even including systems which may undergo ground-state phase transitions. A few applications are described in more detail. The Bose liquid is treated in the extended SUB 2 approximation. It is shown that the ground-state results in the uniform limit are exact and agree with the hypernetted-chain approximation. The modifications due to hard-core interactions and the non-linear equations of motion are also discussed in this case. For Fermi systems it is shown that the supercondictive phase transition of the BCS model Hamiltonian and the deformation phase transition of the Lipkin model are properly obtained by the extended exp S method in a low-order approximation.},

The basis of our bound is a more careful analysis of the log-determinant term appearing in the log marginal likelihood, as well as using the method of conjugate gradients to derive tight lower bounds on the term involving a quadratic form. Our approach is a step forward in unifying methods relying on lower bound maximisation (e.g. variational methods) and iterative approaches based on conjugate gradients for training Gaussian processes. In experiments, we show improved predictive performance with our model for a comparable amount of training time compared to other conjugate gradient based approaches.},

We demonstrate the performance of this method on a test set of molecules of growing size and show that up to 80 \% of single point calculations could be avoided introducing a root mean square deviation in fundamental excitations of about 3 cm\$\^\{-1\}\$. A much higher accuracy with errors below 1 cm\$\^\{-1\}\$ could be achieved with tighter convergence thresholds still reducing the number of single point computations by up to 68 \%. We further support our findings with a detailed analysis of wall times measured while employing different electronic structure methods. Our results demonstrate that GPR-ADGA is an effective tool, which could be applied for cost-efficient calculations of potential energy surfaces suitable for highly-accurate vibrational spectra simulations.},

  abstract = {Dynamical electronic- and vibrational-structure theories have received a growing interest in the past few years due to their ability to simulate spectra recorded with ultrafast experimental techniques. The exact time evolution of a molecular system can, in principle, be obtained from the time-dependent version of full configuration interaction. Such an approach is, however, limited to few-atom systems due to the exponential increase of its cost with the system dimension. In the present work, we overcome this unfavorable scaling by employing the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (TDDMRG) which parametrizes the time-dependent wave function as a matrix product state. The time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation is then integrated with a sweep-based algorithm, as in standard timeindependent DMRG. Unlike other TD-DMRG approaches, the one presented here leads to a set of coupled equations that can be integrated exactly. The resulting theory enables us to study real- and imaginary-time evolutions of Hamiltonians comprising more than 20 degrees of freedom that are challenging for current state-of-the-art quantum dynamics algorithms. We apply our algorithm to the simulation of quantum dynamics of models of increasing complexity, ranging from simple excitonic Hamiltonians to more complex ab initio vibronic ones.},

The resulting downfolded Hamiltonians integrate out the external (out-of-active-space) Fermionic degrees of freedom from the internal (in-the-active-space) parameters of the wave function, which can be determined as components of the eigenvectors of the downfolded Hamiltonians in the active space. This paper will discuss the extension of non-Hermitian (associated with standard CC formulations) and Hermitian (associated with the unitary CC approaches) downfolding formulations to composite quantum systems commonly encountered in materials science and chemistry. The non-Hermitian formulation can provide a platform for developing local CC approaches, while the Hermitian one can serve as an ideal foundation for developing various quantum computing applications based on the limited quantum resources. We also discuss the algorithm for extracting the semianalytical form of the inter-electron interactions in the active spaces.},

  abstract = {An efficient and robust integration scheme tailored to the equations of motion of the multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method is presented. An error estimation allows the automatical adjustment of the step size and hence controls the integration error. The integration scheme decouples the MCTDH equations of motion into several disjoined subsystems, of which one determines the time evolution of the MCTDH-coefficients. While the conventional MCTDH equations are non-linear, the working equation for the MCTDH-coefficients becomes linear in the present integration scheme. To investigate the integrator's performance it is applied to the photodissociation process of methyl iodide. The results of the novel integration scheme are in perfect agreement to those obtained by solving the MCTDH working equations conventionally. The computation time, however, is reduced by a factor of about ten when the new integration scheme is used to propagate large systems.},

  abstract = {A review is given on the multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method, which is an algorithm for propagating wavepackets. The formal derivation, numerical implementation, and performance of the method are detailed. As demonstrated by example applications, MCTDH may perform very efficiently, especially when there are many (typically four to twelve, say) degrees of freedom. The largest system treated with MCTDH to date is the pyrazine molecule, where all 24 (!) vibrational modes were accounted for. The particular representation of the MCTDH wavefunction requires special techniques for generating an initial wavepacket and for analysing the propagated wavefunction. These techniques are discussed. The full efficiency of the MCTDH method is only realised if the Hamiltonian can be written as a sum of products of one-dimensional operators. The kinetic energy operator and many model potential functions already have this required structure. For other potential functions, we describe an efficient algorithm for determining optimal fits of product form. An alternative to the product representation, the correlation discrete variable representation (CDVR) method, is also briefly discussed.},

PennyLane thus extends the automatic differentiation algorithms common in optimization and machine learning to include quantum and hybrid computations. A plugin system makes the framework compatible with any gate-based quantum simulator or hardware. We provide plugins for Strawberry Fields, Rigetti Forest, Qiskit, Cirq, and ProjectQ, allowing PennyLane optimizations to be run on publicly accessible quantum devices provided by Rigetti and IBM Q. On the classical front, PennyLane interfaces with accelerated machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and autograd.

Here, we report the remarkable sensitivity of soft X-ray transient absorption spectroscopy for following the intricate electronic structure changes accompanying the non-adiabatic transition of an excited molecule from the singlet to the triplet manifold. Core-level X-ray spectroscopy at the carbon-1s K-edge (284 eV) is applied to identify the role of the triplet state (T1, 3{$\pi\pi$}*) in the ultraviolet-induced photochemistry of pentane-2,4-dione (acetylacetone, AcAc). The excited-state dynamics initiated at 266 nm (1{$\pi\pi$}*, S2) is investigated with element- and site-specificity using broadband soft X-ray pulses produced by high harmonic generation, in combination with time-dependent density functional theory calculations of the X-ray spectra for the excited electronic singlet and triplet states. The evolution of the core-to-valence resonances at the carbon K-edge establishes an ultrafast population of the T1 state (3{$\pi\pi$}*) in AcAc via intersystem crossing on a 1.5 {$\pm$} 0.2 ps time scale.}

We recall the derivation of the Euler\textendash Poinsot equations of motion both in the frame moving with the body and in the rest frame (the latter ones being less widely known). We find a discrete time Lagrange function turning into the known continuous time Lagrangian in the continuous limit, and elaborate both descriptions of the resulting discrete time system, namely in the body frame and in the rest frame. This system naturally inherits Poisson properties of the continuous time system, the integrals of motion being deformed. The discrete time Lax representations are also found. Kirchhoff's kinetic analogy between elastic curves and motions of the Lagrange top is also generalised to the discrete context.},

The method is based on single-reference theory and therefore has a relatively straightforward formulation and modest computational complexity. The main difference from established methods is the bivariational formulation, in which independent parameterizations of the wave function (ket) and its complex conjugate (bra) are made. Importantly, this allows manifest multiplicative separability of the state (exact in the extended bivar-MRECC version of the method and approximate otherwise), and additive separability of the energy, while preserving polynomial scaling of the working equations. A feature of the bivariational principle is that the formal bra and ket references can be included as bivariational parameters, which eliminates much of the bias toward the formal reference. A pilot implementation is described, and extensive benchmark calculations on several standard problems are performed. The results from the bivar-MRCC method are comparable to established state-specific multireference methods. Considering the relative affordability of the bivar-MRCC method, it may become a practical tool for non-experts.},

  abstract = {In this research, orbital-optimized third-order M\o ller-Plesset perturbation theory (OMP3) and its spin-component and spin-opposite scaled variants (SCS-OMP3 and SOS-OMP3) are introduced. Using a Lagrangian-based approach, an efficient, quadratically convergent algorithm for variational optimization of the molecular orbitals (MOs) for third-order M\o ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP3) is presented. Explicit equations for response density matrices, the MO gradient, and Hessian are reported in spin-orbital form. The OMP3, SCS-OMP3, and SOS-OMP3 approaches are compared with the second-order M\o ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2), MP3, coupled-cluster doubles (CCD), optimized-doubles (OD), and coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) methods. All these methods are applied to the \textbackslash documentclass[12pt]\{minimal\}\textbackslash begin\{document\}\$\{\textbackslash rm O\}\_\{4\} \^\{+\}\$\textbackslash end\{document\}O4+, O3, and seven diatomic molecules. Results demonstrate that the OMP3 and its variants provide significantly better vibrational frequencies than MP3, CCSD, and OD for the molecules where the symmetry-breaking problems are observed. For \textbackslash documentclass[12pt]\{minimal\}\textbackslash begin\{document\}\$\{\textbackslash rm O\}\_\{4\} \^\{+\}\$\textbackslash end\{document\}O4+, the OMP3 prediction, 1343 cm-1, for {$\omega$}6 (b3u) mode, where symmetry-breaking appears, is even better than presumably more reliable methods such as Brueckner doubles (BD), 1194 cm-1, and OD, 1193 cm-1, methods (the experimental value is 1320 cm-1). For O3, the predictions of SCS-OMP3 (1143 cm-1) and SOS-OMP3 (1165 cm-1) are remarkably better than the more robust OD method (1282 cm-1); the experimental value is 1089 cm-1. For the seven diatomics, again the SCS-OMP3 and SOS-OMP3 methods provide the lowest average errors, |{$\Delta\omega$}e| = 44 and |{$\Delta\omega$}e| = 35 cm-1, respectively, while for OD, |{$\Delta\omega$}e| = 161 cm-1and CCSD |{$\Delta\omega$}e| = 106 cm-1. Hence, the OMP3 and especially its spin-scaled variants perform much better than the MP3, CCSD, and more robust OD approaches for considered test cases. Therefore, considering both the computational cost and the reliability, SCS-OMP3 and SOS-OMP3 appear to be the best methods for the symmetry-breaking cases, based on present application results. The OMP3 method offers certain advantages: it provides reliable vibrational frequencies in case of symmetry-breaking problems, especially with spin-scaling tricks, its analytic gradients are easier to compute since there is no need to solve the coupled-perturbed equations for the orbital response, and the computation of one-electron properties are easier because there is no response contribution to the particle density matrices. The OMP3 has further advantages over standard MP3, making it promising for excited state properties via linear response theory.},

  abstract = {Using a Lagrangian-based approach, we present a more elegant derivation of the equations necessary for the variational optimization of the molecular orbitals (MOs) for the coupled-cluster doubles (CCD) method and second-order M\o ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2). These orbital-optimized theories are referred to as OO-CCD and OO-MP2 (or simply ``OD'' and ``OMP2'' for short), respectively. We also present an improved algorithm for orbital optimization in these methods. Explicit equations for response density matrices, the MO gradient, and the MO Hessian are reported both in spin-orbital and closed-shell spin-adapted forms. The Newton-Raphson algorithm is used for the optimization procedure using the MO gradient and Hessian. Further, orbital stability analyses are also carried out at correlated levels. The OD and OMP2 approaches are compared with the standard MP2, CCD, CCSD, and CCSD(T) methods. All these methods are applied to H2O, three diatomics, and the \$\{\textbackslash rm O\}\_4\^+\$O4+ molecule. Results demonstrate that the CCSD and OD methods give nearly identical results for H2O and diatomics; however, in symmetry-breaking problems as exemplified by \$\{\textbackslash rm O\}\_4\^+\$O4+, the OD method provides better results for vibrational frequencies. The OD method has further advantages over CCSD: its analytic gradients are easier to compute since there is no need to solve the coupled-perturbed equations for the orbital response, the computation of one-electron properties are easier because there is no response contribution to the particle density matrices, the variational optimized orbitals can be readily extended to allow inactive orbitals, it avoids spurious second-order poles in its response function, and its transition dipole moments are gauge invariant. The OMP2 has these same advantages over canonical MP2, making it promising for excited state properties via linear response theory. The quadratically convergent orbital-optimization procedure converges quickly for OMP2, and provides molecular properties that are somewhat different than those of MP2 for most of the test cases considered (although they are similar for H2O). Bond lengths are somewhat longer, and vibrational frequencies somewhat smaller, for OMP2 compared to MP2. In the difficult case of \$\{\textbackslash rm O\}\_4\^+\$O4+, results for several vibrational frequencies are significantly improved in going from MP2 to OMP2.},

  abstract = {Matrix elements between nonorthogonal Slater determinants represent an essential component of many emerging electronic structure methods. However, evaluating nonorthogonal matrix elements is conceptually and computationally harder than their orthogonal counterparts. While several different approaches have been developed, these are predominantly derived from the first-quantized generalized Slater\textendash Condon rules and usually require biorthogonal occupied orbitals to be computed for each matrix element. For coupling terms between nonorthogonal excited configurations, a second-quantized approach such as the nonorthogonal Wick's theorem is more desirable, but this fails when the two reference determinants have a zero many-body overlap. In this contribution, we derive an entirely generalized extension to the nonorthogonal Wick's theorem that is applicable to all pairs of determinants with nonorthogonal orbitals. Our approach creates a universal methodology for evaluating any nonorthogonal matrix element and allows Wick's theorem and the generalized Slater\textendash Condon rules to be unified for the first time. Furthermore, we present a simple well-defined protocol for deriving arbitrary coupling terms between nonorthogonal excited configurations. In the case of overlap and one-body operators, this protocol recovers efficient formulas with reduced scaling, promising significant computational acceleration for methods that rely on such terms.},

Burton, J. Chem. Phys. 154, 144109 (2021)], I introduced a generalized extension to the nonorthogonal Wick's theorem that allows matrix elements to be derived between excited configurations from a pair of reference determinants with a singular nonorthogonal orbital overlap matrix. However, that work only provided explicit expressions for one- and two-body matrix elements between singly- or doubly-excited configurations. Here, this framework is extended to compute generalized nonorthogonal matrix elements between higher-order excitations. Pre-computing and storing intermediate values allows one- and two-body matrix elements to be evaluated with an {$\mathscr{O}$} (1) scaling relative to the system size, and the LIBGNME computational library is introduced to achieve this in practice. These advances make the evaluation of all nonorthogonal matrix elements almost as easy as their orthogonal counterparts, facilitating a new phase of development in nonorthogonal electronic structure theory.},

Based on this, we will provide a very detailed reconstruction of the possible Euler parametrisation associated with the so-called symmetric embedding. Then, we will recall how such constructions are related to the Dyson integrals, providing a geometrical interpretation of the latter, at least in certain cases. This includes a short review on the main properties of simple Lie groups, algebras, and their representations.

Using realistic experimental parameters we also derive the anticipated signal strengths for these transient features. This indicates that although recording a signal capturing the strongest transient (i.e. excited state\textendash ground state) changes will be possible for all cases, only with x-ray absorption near-edge structure and extended x-ray absorption fine structure will it be possible to resolve the fine details associated with the wavepacket dynamics within realistic experimental acquisition times.},

Three representations of the matrix-variate GBS density are provided, one of them by using the mentioned connection. The main motivation of this article is based on the fact that the representation of the matrixvariate GBS density based on element-by-element specification does not allow matrix transformations. Consequently, some statistical procedures based on this representation, such as multivariate data analysis and statistical shape theory, cannot be performed. For this reason, the primary goal of this work is to obtain a matrix representation of the matrixvariate GBS density that is useful for some statistical applications. When the GBS density is expressed by means of a matrix representation based on the Hadamard product, such a density is defined in terms of the original matrices, as is common for many matrix-variate distributions, allowing matrix transformations to be handled in a natural way and then suitable statistical procedures to be developed.},

However, the fact that the stochastic gradient is a biased estimator of the full gradient with correlated samples has led to the lack of theoretical understanding of how SGD behaves under correlated settings and hindered its use in such cases. In this paper, we focus on hyperparameter estimation for the Gaussian process (GP) and take a step forward towards breaking the barrier by proving minibatch SGD converges to a critical point of the full log-likelihood loss function, and recovers model hyperparameters with rate \$O(\textbackslash frac\{1\}\{K\})\$ for \$K\$ iterations, up to a statistical error term depending on the minibatch size. Our theoretical guarantees hold provided that the kernel functions exhibit exponential or polynomial eigendecay which is satisfied by a wide range of kernels commonly used in GPs. Numerical studies on both simulated and real datasets demonstrate that minibatch SGD has better generalization over state-of-the-art GP methods while reducing the computational burden and opening a new, previously unexplored, data size regime for GPs.},

As an illustration, we have simulated three multidimensional spectroscopic signals, time- and frequency-resolved fluorescence spectra, transientabsorption pump-probe spectra, and electronic two-dimensional (2D) spectra at finite temperatures, for a conical intersection-mediated singlet fission model of a rubrene crystal. It is shown that a detailed dynamical picture of the singlet fission process can be extracted from the three spectroscopic signals. An increasing temperature leads to lower intensities of the signals and broadened vibrational peaks, which can be attributed to faster singlet-triplet population transfer and stronger bath-induced electronic dephasing at higher temperatures.},

The computational work required to implement implicit Runge-Kutta methods is often dominated by the cost of solving large sets of nonlinear equations. As an alternative to modified Newton methods, iteration schemes, which sacrifice superlinear convergence for reduced linear algebra costs, have been proposed. A new scheme of this type is considered here. This scheme avoids expensive vector transformations, is computationally more efficient, and gives improved performance.},

  abstract = {This work develops and illustrates a new method of calculating ``chemically accurate'' electronic wavefunctions (and energies) via a truncated full configuration interaction (CI) procedure, which arguably circumvents the large matrix diagonalization that is the core problem of full CI and is also central to modern selective CI approaches. This is accomplished simply by following the standard/ubiquitous Davidson method in its ``direct'' form\textemdash wherein, in each iteration, the electronic Hamiltonian operator is applied directly in second quantization to the Ritz vector/wavefunction from the prior iteration\textemdash except that (in this work) only a small portion of the resultant expansion vector is actually even computed (through the application of only a similarly small portion of the Hamiltonian). Specifically, at each iteration of this truncated Davidson approach, the new expansion vector is taken to be twice as large as that from the prior iteration. In this manner, a small set of highly truncated expansion vectors (say 10\textendash 30) of increasing precision is incrementally constructed, forming a small subspace within which diagonalization of the Hamiltonian yields clear, consistent, and monotonically variational convergence to the approximate full CI limit. The good efficiency in which convergence to the level of chemical accuracy (1.6 mhartree) is achieved suggests, at least for the demonstrated problem sizes\textemdash Hilbert spaces of 1018 and wavefunctions of 108 determinants\textemdash that this truncated Davidson methodology can serve as a replacement of standard CI and complete-active space approaches in circumstances where only a few chemically significant digits of accuracy are required and/or meaningful in view of ever-present basis set limitations.},

Recent B\textendash CC applications to problematic systems such as the tetraoxygen cation have provided encouraging examples of the success of this theory. In the present work, we examine the performance of the Brueckner technique for a number of other well-known symmetry-breaking problems, including the formyloxyl radical, the first excited state of NO2 and the nitrate radical. In these cases, B\textendash CC methods are found to fail dramatically, predicting broken-symmetry equilibrium geometries in conflict with experimental and/or higher-level theoretical results. A framework is developed which indicates that these errors can be attributed to artificially exaggerated second-order Jahn\textendash Teller interactions with nearby electronic states. Hence, in spite of their initial successes, Brueckner methods cannot be considered a panacea for symmetry-breaking problems.},

  abstract = {The Born-Oppenheimer approximation underlies much of chemical simulation and provides the framework defining the potential energy surfaces that are used for much of our pictorial understanding of chemical phenomena. However, this approximation breaks down when the dynamics of molecules in excited electronic states are considered. Describing dynamics when the Born-Oppenheimer approximation breaks down requires a quantum mechanical description of the nuclei. Chemical reaction dynamics on excited electronic states is critical for many applications in renewable energy, chemical synthesis, and bioimaging. Furthermore, it is necessary in order to connect with many ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopic experiments. In this review, we provide an overview of methods that can describe nonadiabatic dynamics, with emphasis on those that are able to simultaneously address the quantum mechanics of both electrons and nuclei. Such ab initio quantum molecular dynamics methods solve the electronic Schr\"odinger equation alongside the nuclear dynamics and thereby avoid the need for precalculation of potential energy surfaces and nonadiabatic coupling matrix elements. Two main families of methods are commonly employed to simulate nonadiabatic dynamics in molecules: full quantum dynamics, such as the multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree method, and classical trajectory-based approaches, such as trajectory surface hopping. In this review, we describe a third class of methods that is intermediate between the two: Gaussian basis set expansions built around trajectories.},

This FEP is not a true free energy. Nevertheless, it is common to treat the FEP as the ``free-energy'' analog of the minimum potential energy path and to take the activation free energy, {$\Delta$}FR\textdaggerdbl P, as the difference between the maximum at the transition state and the minimum at R. We show that this approximation can result in large errors. The FEP depends on the CV and is, therefore, not unique. For the same reaction, different discriminating CVs can yield different {$\Delta$}FR\textdaggerdbl P. We derive an exact expression for the activation free energy that avoids this ambiguity. We find {$\Delta$}FR\textdaggerdbl P to be a combination of the probability of the system being in the reactant state, the probability density on the dividing surface, and the thermal de Broglie wavelength associated with the transition. We apply our formalism to simple analytic models and realistic chemical systems and show that the FEP-based approximation applies only at low temperatures for CVs with a small effective mass. Most chemical reactions occur on complex, high-dimensional PES that cannot be treated analytically and pose the added challenge of choosing a good CV. We study the influence of that choice and find that, while the reaction free energy is largely unaffected, {$\Delta$}FR\textdaggerdbl P is quite sensitive.},

We propose novel O(n) approaches to estimating these quantities from only fast matrix vector multiplications (MVMs). These stochastic approximations are based on Chebyshev, Lanczos, and surrogate models, and converge quickly even for kernel matrices that have challenging spectra.  We leverage these approximations to develop a scalable Gaussian process approach to kernel learning. We find that Lanczos is generally superior to Chebyshev for kernel learning, and that a surrogate approach can be highly efficient and accurate with popular kernels.}

We formulate a differential cluster analysis to determine the UCC amplitudes corresponding to a general quantum state. The exactness of conventional UCC (ability to represent any state) is explored numerically, and it is formally shown to be determined by the structure of the critical points of the UCC exponential mapping. A family of disentangled UCC wave functions is proven to exactly parameterize any state, thus showing how to construct Trotter-error-free parameterizations of UCC for applications in quantum computing. From these results, we construct an exact disentangled UCC parameterization that employs an infinite sequence of particle-hole or general one- and two-body substitution operators.}

When the characters of the states agree among different methods, we observe good agreement between the respective NAC vectors, both in the Franck-Condon region and away. In the cases of large discrepancies between the methods, the disagreement can be attributed to the difference in the states' character, which, in some cases, is very sensitive to electron correlation, both within single-reference and multi-reference frameworks. The numeric results confirm that the accuracy of NAC vectors depends critically on the quality of the underlying wave functions. Within their domain of applicability, EOM-CC methods provide a viable alternative to MR approaches.}

The algorithm depends on an integer p {$\geq$} 1 and the quality of the approximation improves as p is increased. The quantum circuit that implements the algorithm consists of unitary gates whose locality is at most the locality of the objective function whose optimum is sought. The depth of the circuit grows linearly with p times (at worst) the number of constraints. If p is fixed, that is, independent of the input size, the algorithm makes use of efficient classical preprocessing. If p grows with the input size a different strategy is proposed. We study the algorithm as applied to MaxCut on regular graphs and analyze its performance on 2-regular and 3-regular graphs for fixed p. For p = 1, on 3-regular graphs the quantum algorithm always finds a cut that is at least 0.6924 times the size of the optimal cut.},

Our theory is exact and has been derived using two completely independent approaches: one inspired by the Hellmann-Feynman theorem and the other following from direct differentiation. (The former is new, while the latter is in the spirit of existing approaches in the literature.) Our expression for the derivative couplings incorporates all Pulay effects associated with the use of an atom-centered basis, and the computational cost is minimal, roughly comparable to that of a single CIS energy gradient. We have validated our method against CIS finite-difference results and have applied it to the lowest lying excited states of naphthalene; we find that naphthalene derivative couplings include Pulay contributions sufficient to have a qualitative effect. Going beyond standard problems in analytic gradient theory, we have also constructed a correction, based on perturbative electron-translation factors, for including electronic momentum and eliminating spurious components of the derivative couplings that break translational symmetry. This correction is general and can be applied to any level of electronic structure theory.}

The existing mathematical analysis is here elaborated in a quantum chemical framework. In particular, we highlight the use of what we have defined as a complete active space-external space gap describing the basis splitting between the complete active space and the external part generalizing the concept of a HOMO-LUMO gap. Furthermore, the behavior of the energy error for an optimal basis splitting, i.e., an active space choice minimizing the density matrix renormalization group-tailored coupled-cluster singles doubles error, is discussed. We show numerical investigations on the robustness with respect to the bond dimensions of the single orbital entropy and the mutual information, which are quantities that are used to choose a complete active space. Moreover, the dependence of the groundstate energy error on the complete active space has been analyzed numerically in order to find an optimal split between the complete active space and external space by minimizing the density matrix renormalization group-tailored coupled-cluster error.},

The standard description and characterization of conical intersections is reviewed and clarified, and a practical and unambiguous system for their classification and interpretation is put forward.

A projection operator, which enforces conditions on the electrons in the bath, is used to obtain the desired state of the molecule.

We present an efficient and general approach to GP inference based on Blackbox Matrix-Matrix multiplication (BBMM). BBMM inference uses a modified batched version of the conjugate gradients algorithm to derive all terms for training and inference in a single call. BBMM reduces the asymptotic complexity of exact GP inference from \$O(n\^3)\$ to \$O(n\^2)\$. Adapting this algorithm to scalable approximations and complex GP models simply requires a routine for efficient matrix-matrix multiplication with the kernel and its derivative. In addition, BBMM uses a specialized preconditioner to substantially speed up convergence. In experiments we show that BBMM effectively uses GPU hardware to dramatically accelerate both exact GP inference and scalable approximations. Additionally, we provide GPyTorch, a software platform for scalable GP inference via BBMM, built on PyTorch.},

Since its first modern use in the 1990s, it has been used to study a wide variety of spectroscopic properties and electronic responses to intense external electromagnetic fields, complex environments, and open quantum systems. It has also been used to study molecular conductance, excited state dynamics, ionization, and nonlinear optical effects. Real-time techniques describe non-perturbative responses of molecules, allowing for studies that go above and beyond the more traditional energy- or frequency-domain-based response theories. Recent progress in signal analysis, accurate treatment of environmental responses, relativistic Hamiltonians, and even quantized electromagnetic fields have opened up new avenues of research in time-dependent molecular response. After discussing the history of real-time methods, we explore some of the necessary mathematical theory behind the methods, and then survey a wide (yet incomplete) variety of applications for real-time methods. We then present some brief remarks on the future of real-time time-dependent electronic structure theory.

However, it is not yet clear whether such algorithms, even in the absence of device error, could achieve quantum advantage for systems of practical interest and how large such an advantage might be. To address these questions, we have performed an exhaustive set of benchmarks to estimate number of qubits and number of measurements required to compute the combustion energies of small organic molecules to within chemical accuracy using VQE as well as state-of-the-art classical algorithms. We consider several key modifications to VQE, including the use of Frozen Natural Orbitals, various Hamiltonian decomposition techniques, and the application of fermionic marginal constraints. Our results indicate that although Frozen Natural Orbitals and low-rank factorizations of the Hamiltonian significantly reduce the qubit and measurement requirements, these techniques are not sufficient to achieve practical quantum computational advantage in the calculation of organic molecule combustion energies. This suggests that new approaches to estimation leveraging quantum coherence, such as Bayesian amplitude estimation [arxiv:2006.09350, arxiv:2006.09349], may be required in order to achieve practical quantum advantage with near-term devices. Our work also highlights the crucial role that resource and performance assessments of quantum algorithms play in identifying quantum advantage and guiding quantum algorithm design.},

We also discuss minimum residual algorithms, review recent related work, and show how the iterations are derived. The important question of preconditioning is then addressed. The preconditioned iterations we develop are based on preserving the skew-symmetry, and we introduce an incomplete 2 \texttimes{} 2 block LDLT decomposition.

  abstract = {SYM-ILDL is a numerical software package that computes incomplete \$LDL\^\{T\}\$ (or `ILDL') factorizations of symmetric indefinite and real skew-symmetric matrices. The core of the algorithm is a Crout variant of incomplete LU (ILU), originally introduced and implemented for symmetric matrices by [Li and Saad, Crout versions of ILU factorization with pivoting for sparse symmetric matrices, Transactions on Numerical Analysis 20, pp. 75--85, 2005]. Our code is economical in terms of storage and it deals with real skew-symmetric matrices as well, in addition to symmetric ones. The package is written in C++ and it is templated, open source, and includes a MATLAB interface. The code includes built-in RCM and AMD reordering, two equilibration strategies, threshold Bunch-Kaufman pivoting and rook pivoting, as well as a wrapper to MC64, a popular matching based equilibration and reordering algorithm. We also include two built-in iterative solvers: SQMR preconditioned with ILDL, or MINRES preconditioned with a symmetric positive definite preconditioner based on the ILDL factorization.},

One of the greater strengths of the formalism expatiated on here is the striking similarities it bears with Dirac's bra-ket notation. For the purpose of illustrating how the formalism can be effectively employed, we use it to solve a quantum optical master equation for a two-level quantum system and find its Kraus operator sum representation. The paper is addressed to students and researchers with some basic knowledge of linear algebra who want to acquire a deeper understanding of the Liouville space formalism. The concepts are conveyed so as to make the application of the formalism to more complex problems in quantum physics straightforward and unencumbered.},

For the purpose of (A) real time evolution, (B) excitation spectra, (C) spectral functions and (D) imaginary time evolution, we show how the geometric approach highlights the necessity to distinguish between two classes of manifolds: K\"ahler and non-K\"ahler. Traditional variational methods typically require the variational family to be a K\"ahler manifold, where multiplication by the imaginary unit preserves the tangent spaces. This covers the vast majority of cases studied in the literature. However, recently proposed classes of generalized Gaussian states make it necessary to also include the non-K\"ahler case, which has already been encountered occasionally. We illustrate our approach in detail with a range of concrete examples where the geometric structures of the considered manifolds are particularly relevant. These go from Gaussian states and group theoretic coherent states to generalized Gaussian states.},

  abstract = {For the first time, equations are derived for computing stationary vibrational states with extended vibrational coupled cluster (EVCC) and for propagating nuclear wave packets using time-dependent EVCC (TDEVCC). Expressions for energies, properties, and auto-correlation functions are given. For TDEVCC, convergence toward the ground state for imaginary-time propagation is shown, as well as separability in the case of non-interacting subsystems. The analysis focuses substantially on the difference between bra and ket parameterizations for EVCC and TDEVCC compared to normal vibrational coupled cluster (VCC) and time-dependent VCC (TDVCC). A pilot implementation is presented within a new full-space framework that offers easy access to completely general, albeit not efficient, implementations of alternative VCC variants, such as EVCC. The new methods were tested on 35 three- and six-mode molecular systems. Both EVCC[k] and TDEVCC[k] showed good, hierarchical convergence toward the exact limit. This convergence was generally better than for normal VCC[k] and TDVCC[k] and better still than for (time-dependent) vibrational configuration interaction, though this should be balanced with the higher computational complexity of EVCC. The results highlight the importance of exponential parameterizations and separability in general, as seen, in particular, for the TDEVCC bra parameterization, which is in contrast to the partially linear one of TDVCC. With the results being rooted in the general structures of coupled cluster (CC) theory, they are expected to be relevant to other applications of both normal and extended CC theory as well.},

Various types of screening provide even further reductions in computational scaling and absolute CPU time. VSCF calculations on large polyaromatic hydrocarbon model systems are presented. Further, it is demonstrated that in cases where distant modes are not directly coupled in the Hamiltonian, down to linear scaling of the required CPU time with respect to the number of vibrational modes can be obtained.

The equations are implemented in the special case of both the Hamiltonian and the cluster operator containing at most two-mode coupling terms. The nontrivial behavior of the evolution of norm, energy, and expectation values due to the nonunitary time-evolution of the nonvariational TDVCC theory is analyzed theoretically and confirmed in numerical experiments that also include time-dependent Hamiltonians. In the spirit of time-independent size-consistency analysis, the separability of both the coupled cluster and {$\Lambda$} states for noninteracting systems is studied. While the coupled cluster state clearly has the correct behavior, the behavior of the {$\Lambda$} state is more intricate, and the consequence for different properties is shown theoretically and numerically. Overall, the numerical experiments show that TDVCC in incomplete expansions gives higher accuracy than a standard linear variational wave function parameterization with the same number of independent parameters, while equivalent results are obtained for complete expansions. The efficiency of the methodology is illustrated in computations on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with up to 156 modes.},

Numerical evidence from previous authors was inconsistent with this claim, yet the small energy differences found between the two methods and the relatively large number of variational parameters precluded an unequivocal conclusion. Using the Lipkin Hamiltonian, we here present conclusive numerical evidence that the two theories yield different energies. The ambiguities arising from the size of the cluster parameter space are absent in the Lipkin model, particularly when truncating to double excitations. We show that in the symmetry adapted basis under strong correlation, the differences between the variational and unitary models are large, whereas they yield quite similar energies in the weakly correlated regime previously explored. We also provide a qualitative argument rationalizing why these two models cannot be the same. Additionally, we study a generalized non-unitary and non-hermitian variant that contains excitation, de-excitation, and mixed operators with different amplitudes and show that it works best when compared to the traditional, variational, unitary, and extended forms of coupled cluster doubles theories.},

We have determined CP FOP series where FOPs are determined as a first energy derivative and also where the FOPs are determined as a generalized expectation value of the external perturbation operator over the coupled cluster state and its biorthonormal multiplier state. For S(D) orbital excitation spaces, we find that the CP series for FOPs that are determined as a first derivative, in general, in second order have errors of a few percent in the singles and doubles correlation contribution relative to the targeted coupled cluster (CC) results. For a SD(T) orbital excitation space, we find that the CP series for FOPs determined as a generalized expectation value in second order have errors of about ten percent in the triples correlation contribution relative to the targeted CC results. These second order models, therefore, constitute viable alternatives for determining high quality FOPs.},

Phys. 2018, 19, 194114] is extended to realistic anharmonic potentials with n-mode representations beyond the linear vibronic coupling model. For realistic vibrational potentials, the local mode representation should give a more compact representation of the potentials, i.e., lowering the dimensionality of the entanglements, than the normal coordinates, and the MPS-MCTDH formulation should work more efficiently and maintain the accuracy with a small bond dimension of the MPS ansatz. In fact, it was confirmed that the use of the local coordinates made the interaction matrices diagonal dominant and the number of terms in the n-body expansion of the potentials was significantly reduced. The method was applied to the IR spectrum of the CH2O molecule, the zeropoint energies, and the vibrational energy redistribution dynamics of polyenes C2nH2n+2. The results showed that the efficiency of the MPS-MCTDH method is significantly accelerated by the use of local coordinates even if the long-range interactions are included in the potential.},

Recent reports have shown that strong coupling of the vibrational modes of solvents to cavity vacuum fields can influence the chemical reaction kinetics of dissolved solutes. This suggests that vibrational strong coupling might also effect other important solution-based processes, such as crystallization from solution. Here we test this hitherto unexplored notion, investigating pseudopolymorphism in the crystallization from water of ZIF metal\textendash organic frameworks inside optical microcavities. We find that ZIF-8 crystals are selectively obtained from solution inside optical microcavities, where the OH stretching vibration of water is strongly coupled to cavity vacuum fields, whereas mixtures of ZIF-8 and ZIF-L are obtained otherwise. Moreover, ZIF crystallization is accelerated by solvent vibrational strong coupling. This work suggests that cavity vacuum fields might become a tool for materials synthesis, biasing molecular self-assembly and driving macroscopic material outcomes.},

  abstract = {A new time-dependent configuration interaction method has been developed for simulating strong field sequential double ionization of molecular systems. Ionization of the neutral is simulated by time-dependent configuration interaction with single excitations (TD-CIS) and an absorbing boundary. At each time step, the ionized part of the wavefunction from the TD-CIS calculation is transferred to a second time-dependent configuration interaction simulation for ionization of the cation to the dication. The second simulation uses a CISD-IP wavefunction that consists of singly ionized configurations and singly excited, singly ionized configurations (TD-CISD-IP). The transfer between the TD-CIS and TD-CISD-IP simulations is accomplished by partitioning the first ionization rate into contributions from individual orbitals or by singular value decomposition of the absorbed wavefunction. Sequential double ionization simulations have been carried out for HBr in five cycle 800~nm linearly polarized pulses and HI (with spin\textendash orbit coupling) in four cycle 800~nm circularly polarized pulses, with intensities chosen so that the population of the neutral was depleted by the mid-pulse. The singular value decomposition of the cation produced by the first ionization is dominated by a single component for the two orientations considered. The population of the cation rises and then falls as it is ionized to the dication. Depending on the pulse shape and field strength, the ionization of the cation to the dication can continue for several half cycles. For HI with circularly polarized light, the rates for both the first and second ionization peak when the electric field is aligned with the p{$\pi$} orbital.}

The time-dependent basis functions are linearly parameterized and their fully variational time evolution is ensured by solving a set of so-called constraint equations, which we derive for arbitrary wave function expansions. The formalism allows division of the basis set into an active basis and a secondary basis, ensuring a flexible and compact wave function. We show how the EOMs specialize to a few common wave function forms, including coupled cluster and linearly expanded wave functions. It is demonstrated, for the first time, that the propagation of such wave functions is not unconditionally stable when a secondary basis is employed. The main signature of the instability is a strong increase in non-orthogonality, which eventually causes the calculation to fail; specifically, the biorthogonal active bra and ket bases tend toward spanning different spaces. Although formally allowed, this causes severe numerical issues. We identify the source of this problem by reparametrizing the time-dependent basis set through polar decomposition. Subsequent analysis allows us to remove the instability by setting appropriate matrix elements to zero. Although this solution is not fully variational, we find essentially no deviation in terms of autocorrelation functions relative to the variational formulation. We expect that the results presented here will be useful for the formal analysis of bivariational time-dependent wave functions for electronic and nuclear dynamics in general and for the practical implementation of time-dependent CC wave functions in particular.},

Transient X-ray absorption spectroscopy (TXAS) provides a powerful technique for probing the dynamics of valence states by exciting the electrons into high-lying core excited states. We employ multiconfigurational self-consistent field calculations to investigate the TXAS of uracil along its nonradiative photodecay pathways. An open issue is whether dark n{$\pi$}* state S1 (n is the lone pair localized on an oxygen atom) is accessible when bright {$\pi\pi$}* state S2 is selectively excited. Vertical core excitations were calculated along the potential energy surfaces of the three lowest states, S0\textendash S2, interpolated between two minima and two minimum-energy conical intersections. Computed TXAS data from the C, N, and O K edges show distinct spectral fingerprints of the dark state in all spectral regimes. At the O 1s edge, the n{$\pi$}* state has a very strong absorption at 526\textendash 527 eV, while at the C (N) 1s edge, by contrast, there is almost zero (very weak) absorption at 279\textendash 282 eV (397\textendash 398 eV). All K-edge spectra can be used to sensitively detect the dark states. Our proposed O 1s feature has already been observed in a recent TXAS experiment with thymine. Natural transition orbital analysis is used to interpret all dominant features of the three lowest-valence states along the reaction coordinate and reveal some important valence fine-structure information from the core excitation.}

  abstract = {The computation of the nuclear quantum dynamics of molecules is challenging, requiring both accuracy and efficiency to be applicable to systems of interest. Recently, theories have been developed for employing time-dependent basis functions (denoted modals) with vibrational coupled cluster theory (TDMVCC). The TDMVCC method was introduced along with a pilot implementation, which illustrated good accuracy in benchmark computations. In this paper we report an efficient implementation of TDMVCC covering the case where the wave function and Hamiltonian contain up to two-mode couplings. After a careful regrouping of terms, the wave function can be propagated with a cubic computational scaling with respect to the number of degrees of freedom. We discuss the use of a restricted set of active one-mode basis functions for each mode, as well as two interesting limits: i) the use of a full active basis where the variational modal determination amounts essentially to the variational determination of a time-dependent reference state for the cluster expansion; and ii) the use of a single function as active basis for some degrees of freedom. The latter case defines a hybrid TDMVCC/TDH approach which can obtain an even lower computational scaling. The resulting computational scaling for hybrid and full TDMVCC[2] are illustrated for polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with up to 264 modes. Finally, computations on the internal vibrational redistribution on benzoic acid (39 modes) are used to show the faster convergence of TDMVCC/TDH hybrid computations towards TDMVCC compared to simple neglect of some degrees of freedom.},

  abstract = {Quantum computers can be used to address molecular structure, materials science and condensed matter physics problems, which currently stretch the limits of existing high-performance computing resources. Finding exact numerical solutions to these interacting fermion problems has exponential cost, while Monte Carlo methods are plagued by the fermionic sign problem. These limitations of classical computational methods have made even few-atom molecular structures problems of practical interest for medium-sized quantum computers. Yet, thus far experimental implementations have been restricted to molecules involving only Period I elements. Here, we demonstrate the experimental optimization of up to six-qubit Hamiltonian problems with over a hundred Pauli terms, determining the ground state energy for molecules of increasing size, up to BeH2. This is enabled by a hardware-efficient variational quantum eigensolver with trial states specifically tailored to the available interactions in our quantum processor, combined with a compact encoding of fermionic Hamiltonians and a robust stochastic optimization routine. We further demonstrate the flexibility of our approach by applying the technique to a problem of quantum magnetism. Across all studied problems, we find agreement between experiment and numerical simulations with a noisy model of the device. These results help elucidate the requirements for scaling the method to larger systems, and aim at bridging the gap between problems at the forefront of high-performance computing and their implementation on quantum hardware.},

The HOLCs are obtained as a compromise between the recently promoted optimized coordinates (OCs) and localized coordinates (LCs). The three sets of coordinates are generally different from each other and differ from standard normal coordinates (NCs) as well. In determining the HOLCs, we optimize the vibrational self-consistent field (VSCF) energy with respect to orthogonal transformation of the coordinates, which is similar to determining OCs but for HOLCs we additionally introduce a penalty for delocalization, by using a measure of localization similar to that employed in determining LCs. The same theory and implementation covers OCs, LCs, and HOLCs. It is shown that varying one penalty parameter allows for connecting OCs and LCs. The HOLCs are compared to NCs, OCs, and LCs in their nature and performance as basis for vibrational coupled cluster (VCC) response calculations of vibrational anharmonic energies for a small set of simple systems comprising water, formaldehyde, and ethylene. It is found that surprisingly good results can be obtained with HOLCs by using potential energy surfaces as simple as quadratic Taylor expansions. Quite similar coordinates are found for the already established OCs but obtaining these OCs requires much more elaborate and expensive potential energy surfaces and localization is generally not guaranteed. The ability to compute HOLCs for somewhat larger systems is demonstrated for coumarin and the alanine quadramer. The good agreement between HOLCs and OCs, together with the much easier applicability of HOLCs for larger systems, suggests that HOLCs may be a pragmatically very interesting option for anharmonic calculations on medium to large molecular systems.},

In DMET, empirical approaches to strong coupling, such as link atoms or boundary regions, are replaced by a small, rigorous quantum bath designed to reproduce the entanglement between a fragment and its environment. We describe the theory and demonstrate its feasibility in strongly correlated hydrogen ring and grid models; these are not only beyond the scope of traditional embeddings but even challenge conventional quantum chemistry methods themselves. We find that DMET correctly describes the notoriously difficult symmetric dissociation of a 4 \texttimes{} 3 hydrogen atom grid, even when the treated fragments are as small as single hydrogen atoms. We expect that DMET will open up new ways of treating complex strongly coupled, strongly correlated systems in terms of their individual fragments.},

In this contribution, we investigate some aspects of an ansatz, using generalized two-body excitation operators, which have been considered in some recent studies on quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry. Our numerical results show that, in particular, two-body operators with effective particle\textendash hole excitation level of one in connection with the usual particle\textendash hole double excitation operators lead to a very accurate, yet compact representation of the wavefunction. Generalized two-body operators with effective excitation rank zero have a considerably less pronounced effect. We compare with standard and unitary coupled-cluster expansions and show that the above mentioned approach matches or even surpasses the accuracy of expansions with three-body particle\textendash hole excitations, in particular at the onset of strong correlation. A downside of the approach is that it is rather difficult to rigorously converge it to its variational minimum.},

It is also shown that the residual terms arising in the case of an approximate complete active space configuration interaction solution and containing even the fifth-order density matrix for two excitation classes can be evaluated with little additional effort by choosing again a favorable factorization of the corresponding matrix elements. An analogous argument is also provided for avoiding the fourth-order density matrix in complete active space second-order perturbation theory.

The interpretation of vibrational spectra requires, in most cases, computational assistance and account for anharmonic effects. Pushing the size limitations of anharmonic vibrational structure calculations is therefore of great interest. Fortunately, interpretation of the experimental results often requires only a limited part of the vibrational spectrum. Hence, it can be expected that multilevel approaches, focusing computational effort on the relevant parts, are highly beneficial. Still, such approaches are rather sparse in the field of vibrational structure theory. In this perspective, we outline the present status on multilevel static vibrational wave functions and rectilinear vibrational coordinates.

We show that, within our framework, the gradient of an expectation value with respect to a parameterized               n               -fold fermionic excitation can be evaluated by four expectation values of similar form and size, whereas most standard approaches, based on the direct application of the parameter-shift-rule, come with an associated cost of                              expectation values. For real wavefunctions, this cost can be further reduced to two expectation values. Our strategies are implemented within the open-source package Tequila and allow blackboard style construction of differentiable objective functions. We illustrate initial applications through extended adaptive approaches for electronic ground and excited states.},

We apply the TDOMP2 method to extract absorption spectra and frequencydependent polarizabilities and first hyperpolarizabilities from RT simulations, comparing the results with those obtained from conventional time-dependent coupled-cluster singles and doubles (TDCCSD) simulations and from its second-order approximation, TDCC2.

Our results indicate that while TDOMP2 absorption spectra are of the same quality as TDCC2 spectra, including core excitations where optimized orbitals might be particularly important, frequency-dependent polarizabilities and hyperpolarizabilities from TDOMP2 simulations are significantly closer to TDCCSD results than those from TDCC2 simulations.},

Our numerical experiments show that orbitaladaptive time-dependent coupled-cluster doubles (OATDCCD) theory offers significantly improved stability compared with the conventional Hartree-Fock-based time-dependent coupled-cluster singles-and-doubles (TDCCSD) formulation. The improved stability stems from greatly reduced oscillations in the doubles amplitudes, which, in turn, can be traced to the dynamic biorthonormal reference determinants of OATDCCD theory. As long as these are good approximations to the Brueckner determinant, OATDCCD theory is numerically stable. We propose the reference weight as a diagnostic quantity to identify situations where the TDCCSD and OATDCCD theories become unstable.},

  abstract = {The nondynamical correlation energy may be defined as the difference between full configuration interaction within the space of all valence orbitals and a single determinant of molecular orbitals (Hartree\textendash Fock theory). In order to describe bond breaking, diradicals, and other electronic structure problems where Hartree\textendash Fock theory fails, a reliable description of nondynamical correlation is essential as a starting point. Unfortunately, the exact calculation of nondynamical correlation energy, as defined above, involves computational complexity that grows exponentially with molecular size and is thus unfeasible beyond systems of just two or three heavy atoms. We introduce a new hierarchy of feasible approximations to the nondynamical correlation energy based on coupled-cluster theory with variationally optimized orbitals. The simplest member of this hierarchy involves connected double excitations within the variationally optimized valence active space and may be denoted as VOO-CCD, or VOD. VOO-CCD is size-consistent, has computational complexity proportional to the sixth power of molecule size, and is expected to accurately approximate the nondynamical correlation energy in such cases as single bond dissociation, diradicals, and anti-ferromagnetic coupling. We report details of our implementation of VOO-CCD and illustrate that it does indeed accurately recover the nondynamical correlation energy for challenging multireference problems such as the torsion of ethylene and chemical bond breaking.},

A new method is proposed for the counter-transformation of the linear expansion coefficients of a full CI wave function under a nonsingular transformation of the molecular-orbital basis. The method, which consists in a straightforward application of the Cauchy\textendash Binet formula to the definition of a Slater determinant, is shown to be simple and suitable for efficient implementation on current high-performance computers. The new method appears mainly beneficial to the calculation of miscellaneous transition matrix elements among individually optimized CASSCF states and to the re-evaluation of the CASCI expansion coefficients in Slater-determinant bases formed from arbitrarily rotated (e.g., localized or, conversely, delocalized) active molecular orbitals. \textcopyright{} 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

It is demonstrated that a modest quadratic vibronic coupling model, parameterized by the quasidiabatic ansatz, is sufficient to accurately recreate all the observed vibronic interactions.

  abstract = {We introduce a unitary coupled-cluster (UCC) ansatz termed k-UpCCGSD that is based on a family of sparse generalized doubles operators, which provides an affordable and systematically improvable unitary coupled-cluster wave function suitable for implementation on a near-term quantum computer. kUpCCGSD employs k products of the exponential of pair coupledcluster double excitation operators (pCCD), together with generalized single excitation operators. We compare its performance in both efficiency of implementation and accuracy with that of the generalized UCC ansatz employing the full generalized single and double excitation operators (UCCGSD), as well as with the standard ansatz employing only single and double excitations (UCCSD). k-UpCCGSD is found to show the best scaling for quantum computing applications, requiring a circuit depth of 6(kN), compared with 6(N3) for UCCGSD, and 6((N - {$\eta$})2{$\eta$}) for UCCSD, where N is the number of spin orbitals and {$\eta$} is the number of electrons. We analyzed the accuracy of these three ansa\"t ze by making classical benchmark calculations on the ground state and the first excited state of H4 (STO-3G, 6-31G), H2O (STO-3G), and N2 (STO-3G), making additional comparisons to conventional coupled cluster methods. The results for ground states show that k-UpCCGSD offers a good trade-off between accuracy and cost, achieving chemical accuracy for lower cost of implementation on quantum computers than both UCCGSD and UCCSD. UCCGSD is also found to be more accurate than UCCSD but at a greater cost for implementation. Excited states are calculated with an orthogonally constrained variational quantum eigensolver approach. This is seen to generally yield less accurate energies than for the corresponding ground states. We demonstrate that using a specialized multideterminantal reference state constructed from classical linear response calculations allows these excited state energetics to be improved.},

We present selected numerical examples which demonstrate the excellent accuracy, conservation and convergence characteristics of AVIs. In these tests, AVIs are found to result in substantial speed-ups, at equal accuracy, relative to explicit Newmark. A mathematical proof of convergence of the AVIs is also presented in this paper. Finally, we develop the subject of horizontal variations and configurational forces in discrete dynamics. This theory leads to exact path-independent characterizations of the configurational forces acting on discrete systems. Notable examples are the configurational forces acting on material nodes in a finite element discretisation; and the J-integral at the tip of a crack in a finite element mesh.

  abstract = {We derive a family of equations-of-motion (EOMs) for evolving multi-layer multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH) wavefunctions that, unlike the standard ML-MCTDH EOMs, never require the evaluation of the inverse of singular matrices. All members of this family of EOMs make use of alternative static gauge conditions than those used for standard ML-MCTDH. These alternative conditions result in an expansion of the wavefunction in terms of a set of potentially arbitrary orthonormal functions, rather than in terms of a set of non-orthonormal and potentially linearly dependent functions, as is the case for standard ML-MCTDH. We show that the EOMs used in the projector splitting integrator (PSI) and the invariant EOM approaches are two special cases of this family obtained from different choices for the dynamic gauge condition, with the invariant EOMs making use of a choice that introduces potentially unbounded operators into the EOMs. As a consequence, all arguments for the existence of parallelizable integration schemes for the invariant EOMs can also be applied to the PSI EOMs.},

Phys. 151, 154116 (2019)] is presented. The general framework developed for time-independent vibrational coupled cluster (VCC) calculations has been extended to the time-dependent context. This results in an efficient implementation of TDVCC with general coupling levels in the cluster operator and Hamiltonian. Thus, the convergence of the TDVCC[k] hierarchy toward the complete-space limit can be studied for any sum-of-product Hamiltonian. Furthermore, a scheme for including selected higher-order excitations for a subset of modes is introduced and studied numerically. Three different definitions of the TDVCC autocorrelation function (ACF) are introduced and analyzed in both theory and numerical experiments. Example calculations are presented for an array of systems including imidazole, formyl fluoride, formaldehyde, and a reduced-dimensionality bithiophene model. The results show that the TDVCC[k] hierarchy converges systematically toward the full-TDVCC limit and that the implementation allows accurate quantum-dynamics simulations of large systems to be performed. Specifically, the intramolecular vibrational-energy redistribution of the 21-dimensional imidazole molecule is studied in terms of the decay of the ACF. Furthermore, the importance of product separability in the definition of the ACF is highlighted when studying non-interacting subsystems.},

  abstract = {Solving the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation (TDSE) for large molecular systems is a complicated task due to the inherent exponential scaling of the problem. One of the most successful and versatile methods for obtaining numerically converged solutions for small to medium-sized systems is multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH). In a recent publication [J. Chem. Phys. 2020, 152, 084101] we introduced a hierarchy of approximations to the MCTDH method which mitigate the exponential scaling by truncating the configuration space based on a maximum excitation level w.r.t. a selected reference configuration. The MCTDH[n] methods are able to treat large systems, but the single-reference Ansatz is not optimal in cases where one (or a few) degrees of freedom are special. Examples could be double-well systems, intramolecular vibrational-energy redistribution (IVR) calculations, or nonadiabatic dynamics. In this work we introduce a multireference (MR) extension to the MCTDH[n] methods where selected higher-order excitations for the special degrees of freedom can be introduced in a simple but flexible way. The resulting MR-MCTDH[n] methods allow for, for example, treating nonadiabatic dynamics within the single-set formalism with the wave packets on each electronic surface described using the same level of approximation. Example calculations are performed on formyl fluoride (IVR), salicylaldimine (double well), and pyrazine (nonadiabatic dynamics). The results show that fast convergence is achieved by extending the configuration space in the special modes that govern the quantum dynamics.},

  abstract = {The multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method is a powerful method for solving the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation in quantum molecular dynamics. It is, however, hampered by the so-called curse of dimensionality which results in exponential scaling with respect to the number of degrees of freedom in the system and, thus, limits its applicability to small- and medium-sized molecules. To avoid this scaling, we derive equations of motion for a series of truncated MCTDH methods using a many-mode second-quantization formulation where the configuration space is restricted based on mode-combination levels as also done in the vibrational configuration interaction and vibrational coupled cluster methods for solving the time-independent Schr\"odinger equation. The full MCTDH wave function is invariant with respect to the choice of constraint (or gauge) operators, but restricting the configuration space removes this invariance. We, thus, analyze the remaining redundancies and derive equations for variationally optimizing the non-redundant matrix elements of the constraint operators. As an alternative, we also present a constraint that keeps the density matrices block diagonal during the propagation and the two choices are compared. Example calculations are performed on formyl fluoride and a series of high-dimensional Henon\textendash Heiles potentials. The results show that the MCTDH[n] methods can be applied to large systems and that an optimal choice of constraint operators is key to obtaining the correct physical behavior of the wave function.},

A biorthogonal second quantization formulation of many-mode dynamics is introduced, allowing separate biorthogonal bases for the bra and ket states, thus ensuring complex analyticity. We employ the time-dependent bivariational principle to derive equations of motion for both the one-mode basis functions and the parameters describing the cluster (T) and linear de-excitation (L) operators. The choice of constraint (or gauge) operators for the modal time evolution is discussed. In the case of untruncated cluster expansion, the result is independent of this choice, but restricting the excitation space removes this invariance; equations for the variational determination of the constraint operators are derived for the latter case. We show that all singleexcitation parts of T and L are redundant and can be left out in the case of variationally determined constraint-operator evolution. Based on a pilot implementation, test computations on Henon\textendash Heiles model systems, the water molecule, and a reduced-dimensionality bi-thiophene model are presented, showing highly encouraging results for TDMVCC. It is demonstrated how TDMVCC in the limit of a complete cluster expansion becomes equivalent to multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree for the same active-space size. Similarly, it is discussed how TDMVCC generally gives better and more stable results than its time-independent-modals counterpart, while equivalent results are obtained for complete expansions and full one-mode basis sets.},

However, with major differences between the electronic and vibrational structures of molecules, the question of how the resource requirements of computing anharmonic, vibrational states can be reduced remains relatively unexplored compared to its electronic counterpart. Importantly, bosonic commutation relations, distinguishable Hilbert spaces and vibrational coordinates allow manipulations of the vibrational system that can be exploited to minimize resource requirements. In this work, we investigate the impact of different coordinate systems and measurement schemes on the number of measurements needed to estimate anharmonic, vibrational states for a variety of three-mode (six-mode) molecules. We demonstrate an average of 3-fold (1.5-fold), with up to 7-fold (2.5-fold), reduction in the number of measurements required by employing appropriate coordinate transformations, based on an automized construction of qubit Hamiltonians from a conventional vibrational structure program.},

The  variational technique gives a unified treatment of many symplectic schemes,  including those of higher order, as well as a natural treatment of the discrete  Noether theorem. The approach also allows us to include forces, dissipation  and constraints in a natural way. Amongst the many specific schemes treated  as examples, the Verlet, SHAKE, RATTLE, Newmark, and the symplectic  partitioned Runge\textendash Kutta schemes are presented.},

  abstract = {In order to simplify the numerical solution of the time-dependent or time-independent Schr\"odinger equations associated with atomic and molecular motions, the use of well-adapted coordinates is essential. Usually, this set of curvilinear coordinates leads to a Hamiltonian operator that is as separable as possible. Although their corresponding kinetic energy operator (KEO) expressions can be derived               analytically               for small systems or special kinds of coordinates, a               numerical               and               exact               approach allows one to compute them in terms of sophisticated curvilinear coordinates. Furthermore, the               numerical               approach enables one to easily define reduced-dimensionality or constrained models. We present here a recent implementation of this               numerical               approach that allows nested coordinate transformations, therefore leading to great flexibility in the definition of the curvilinear coordinates. Furthermore, this implementation has no limitations in terms of numbers of atoms or coordinate transformations. The quantum dynamics of the cis\textendash trans photoisomerization of part of the retinal chromophore illustrates the construction of the coordinates and KEO part of a three-dimensional model.

Following a proposal by Werner and Knowles (J. Chem.

We exploit a simultaneous optimization of the MPS wave function and molecular orbitals in order to achieve quadratic convergence. In contrast to previously reported (augmented Hessian) Newton-Raphson and superconfiguration-interaction algorithms for DMRG-SCF, energy convergence beyond a quadratic scaling is possible in our ansatz. Discarding the set of redundant active-active orbital rotations, the DMRG-SCF energy converges typically within two to four cycles of the selfconsistent procedure.},

Many of these geometric properties are of crucial importance in physical applications: preservation of energy, momentum, angular momentum, phase-space volume, symmetries, time-reversal symmetry, symplectic structure and dissipation are examples. In this paper we present a survey of geometric numerical integration methods for ordinary differential equations. Our aim has been to make the review of use for both the novice and the more experienced practitioner interested in the new developments and directions of the past decade. To this end, the reader who is interested in reading up on detailed technicalities will be provided with numerous signposts to the relevant literature.},

The first rule was never to accept anything as true unless I recognized it to  be certainly and evidently such \ldots. The second was to divide each of the difficulties  which I encountered into as many parts as possible, and as might be  required for an easier solution               . (Descartes)                                         We survey splitting methods for the numerical integration of ordinary differential  equations (ODEs). Splitting methods arise when a vector field can be  split into a sum of two or more parts that are each simpler to integrate than  the original (in a sense to be made precise). One of the main applications of  splitting methods is in geometric integration, that is, the integration of vector  fields that possess a certain geometric property (               e.g.               , being Hamiltonian, or  divergence-free, or possessing a symmetry or first integral) that one wants  to preserve. We first survey the classification of geometric properties of dynamical  systems, before considering the theory and applications of splitting  in each case. Once a splitting is constructed, the pieces are composed to form  the integrator; we discuss the theory of such `composition methods' and summarize  the best currently known methods. Finally, we survey applications  from celestial mechanics, quantum mechanics, accelerator physics, molecular  dynamics, and fluid dynamics, and examples from dynamical systems, biology  and reaction\textendash diffusion systems.},

Recent technological and methodological improvements, such as high repetition rate lasers and femtosecond laser-electron slicing have made this a reality. The advent of X-ray free electron lasers introduces a paradigm shift in terms of the temporal resolution of X-ray spectroscopies, and offer exciting possibilities for time-resolved second-order X-ray spectroscopies and non-linear X-ray experiments. In parallel, the improved data quality is making it increasingly important to accurately simulate the fine spectroscopic details. This has been the driving force for new theoretical methods permitting a detailed interpretation of the spectra in terms of the geometrical and electronic properties of the system. In this contribution, we discuss recent experimental and theoretical developments in ultrafast X-ray absorption spectroscopies (XAS) and explore the new opportunities they offer.},

  abstract = {Over the past decade, the possibility of manipulating chemistry and material properties using hybrid light-matter states has stimulated considerable interest. Hybrid light-matter states can be generated by placing molecules in an optical cavity that is resonant with a molecular transition. Importantly, the hybridization occurs even in the dark because the coupling process involves the zero-point fluctuations of the optical mode (a.k.a. vacuum field) and the molecular transition. In other words, unlike photochemistry, no real photon is required to induce this strong coupling phenomenon. Strong coupling in general, but vibrational strong coupling (VSC) in particular, offers exciting possibilities for molecular and, more generally, material science. Not only is it a new tool to control chemical reactivity, but it also gives insight into which vibrations are involved in a reaction. This Perspective gives the underlying fundamentals of light-matter strong coupling, including a mini-tutorial on the practical issues to achieve VSC. Recent advancements in ``vibro-polaritonic chemistry'' and related topics are presented along with the challenges for this exciting new field.},

  abstract = {We report an explicitly time-dependent approach to the generation of linear absorption spectra for molecular systems within the framework of equation-of-motion (EOM) coupled-cluster (CC) theory. While most time-dependent CC approaches consider the perturbation and timeevolution of a CC wave function, the present work considers the time-evolution of a CC dipole function. The dipole function formalism introduces no approximations and requires the evolution of only one time-dependent quantity, either the left or right dipole function. This time-dependent framework can be used to compute linear absorption spectra for molecules with a high density of states over a broad spectral range, a case for which conventional frequencydomain computations may become impractical. We validate the approach by comparing absorption spectra for small molecules computed at EOM secondorder approximate CC (CC2) and time-dependent EOM-CC2 (TD-EOM-CC2) levels of theory. TD-EOM-CC2 computations are also used to predict extreme ultraviolet absorption spectra for third-row ions that are in reasonable agreement with experiment.},

Here, we present results obtained with the ARROW force field (FF)\dbend a multipolar polarizable and physics-based model with all parameters fitted entirely to high-level ab initio quantum mechanical (QM) calculations. ARROW has already proven its ability to determine solvation free energy of arbitrary neutral compounds with unprecedented accuracy. The ARROW FF parameterization is now extended to include coverage of all amino acids including charged groups, allowing molecular simulations of a series of protein- ligand systems and prediction of their relative binding free energies. We ensure adequate sampling by applying a novel technique that is based on coupling the Hamiltonian Replica exchange (HREX) with a conformation reservoir generated via potential softening and nonequilibrium MD. ARROW provides predictions with near chemical accuracy (mean absolute error of {$\sim$}0.5 kcal/mol) for two of the three protein systems studied here (MCL1 and Thrombin). The third protein system (CDK2) reveals the difficulty in accurately describing dimer interaction energies involving polar and charged species. Overall, for all of the three protein systems studied here, ARROW FF predicts relative binding free energies of ligands with a similar accuracy level as leading nonpolarizable force fields.},

In this paper, we report an extension of this method to the calculation of excited state core photoionization cross-sections. We demonstrate that, at the ADC(2)x level of theory, ground state X-ray absorption spectra may be accurately reproduced, validating the method. Significantly, the calculated X-ray absorption spectra of the excited states are found to be sensitive to both geometric distortions (structural dynamics) and the electronic character (electronic dynamics) of the initial state, suggesting that core excitation spectroscopies will be useful probes of excited state non-adiabatic dynamics. We anticipate that the method presented here can be combined with ab initio molecular dynamics calculations to simulate the time-resolved X-ray spectroscopy of excited state molecular wavepacket dynamics.}

Ongoing developments in ultrafast extreme vacuum ultraviolet (XUV) and soft X-ray sources present new probes of coupled electronic-structural dynamics because of their novel and desirable characteristics. As one example, inner-shell spectroscopy offers localized, atom-specific probes of evolving electronic structure and bonding (via chemical shifts). In this work, we present the first on-the-fly ultrafast X-ray time-resolved absorption spectrum simulations of excited state wavepacket dynamics: photo-excited ethylene. This was achieved by coupling the ab initio multiple spawning (AIMS) method, employing on-the-fly dynamics simulations, with high-level algebraic diagrammatic construction (ADC) X-ray absorption cross-section calculations. Using the excited state dynamics of ethylene as a test case, we assessed the ability of X-ray absorption spectroscopy to project out the electronic character of complex wavepacket dynamics, and evaluated the sensitivity of the calculated spectra to large amplitude nuclear motion. In particular, we demonstrate the pronounced sensitivity of the pre-edge region of the X-ray absorption spectrum to the electronic and structural evolution of the excited-state wavepacket. We conclude that ultrafast time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy may become a powerful tool in the interrogation of excited state non-adiabatic molecular dynamics.},

These non-Born-Oppenheimer effects are governed by general electronic degeneracies termed conical intersections, which play a key role, analogous to that of a transition state, in the electronic-nuclear dynamics of excited molecules. Using high-level ab initio quantum dynamics simulations, we studied time-resolved x-ray absorption (TRXAS) and photoelectron spectroscopy (TRXPS) of the prototypical unsaturated organic chromophore, ethylene, following excitation to its S2({$\pi\pi{_\ast}$}) state. The TRXAS, in particular, is highly sensitive to all aspects of the ensuing dynamics. These x-ray spectroscopies provide a clear signature of the wave packet dynamics near conical intersections, related to charge localization effects driven by the nuclear dynamics. Given the ubiquity of charge localization in excited state dynamics, we believe that ultrafast x-ray spectroscopies offer a unique and powerful route to the direct observation of dynamics around conical intersections.},

We employ quantum wavepacket dynamics simulations on a 5-dimensional potential energy surface (PES) calculated by time-dependent density functional theory with 26 coupled diabatic states. The simulations are initiated by explicit inclusion of a time-dependent electromagnetic field. In the case of resonant excitation into singlet metal-to-ligand charge transfer (1MLCT) states, kinetic (exponential) population dynamics are observed with small nuclear motion. In agreement with transient optical absorption spectroscopy experiments, we observe a subpicosecond 1MLCT \textrightarrow{} 3MLCT intersystem crossing and a subsequent decay into triplet metal-centered (3MC) states on a picosecond time scale. The simulated time-resolved difference scattering signal is dominated by the 3MC component, for which the structural distortions are significant. On the other hand, excitation into 1MC states leads to ballistic (nonexponential) population dynamics with strong nuclear motion. The reason for these ballistic dynamics is that in this case, the excitation occurs into a nonequilibrium region, i.e., far from the minimum of the 1MC PES. This results in wavepacket dynamics along the principal breathing mode, which is clearly visible in both the population dynamics and difference scattering. Finally, the importance of decomposing the difference scattering into components by electronic states is highlighted, information which is not accessible from elastic X-ray scattering experiments.},

  abstract = {The probability of nonradiative transitions in photochemical dynamics is determined by the derivative couplings, the couplings between different electronic states through the nuclear degrees of freedom. Efficient and accurate evaluation of the derivative couplings is, therefore, of central importance to realize reliable computer simulations of photochemical reactions. In this work, the derivative couplings for multistate multireference second-order perturbation theory (MS-CASPT2) and its ``extended'' variant (XMS-CASPT2) are studied, in which we present an algorithm for their analytical evaluation. The computational costs for evaluating the derivative couplings are essentially the same as those for calculating the nuclear energy gradients. The geometries and energies calculated with XMS-CASPT2 for small molecules at minimum energy conical intersections (MECIs) are in good agreement with those computed by multireference configuration interaction. As numerical examples, MECIs are optimized using XMS-CASPT2 for stilbene and a green fluorescent protein model chromophore (the 4-para-hydroxybenzylidene-1,2-dimethyl-imidazolin-5-one anion).}

The response functions and their residues behave physically correctly. Spectroscopic observables are identified as residues, whereas the identification of individual transition matrix elements is prohibited. Thus the unphysical behavior of previously published coupled cluster response functions may be viewed not as a consequence of the projection, but rather that identifications are made on the basis of an unphysical expectation value or quasienergy.},

Projectors heuristically defined from linear response theory and equation-of-motion CC theory are proposed for the calculation of stationary-state populations during interaction with laser pulses or other external forces, and conservation laws of the populations are discussed. Numerical tests of the proposed projectors, involving both linear and nonlinear optical processes for He and Be atoms and for LiH, CH+, and LiF molecules show that the laser-driven evolution of the stationary-state populations at the coupled-cluster singles-and-doubles (CCSD) level is very close to that obtained by full configuration interaction (FCI) theory, provided that all stationary states actively participating in the dynamics are sufficiently well approximated. When double-excited states are important for the dynamics, the quality of the CCSD results deteriorates. Observing that populations computed from the linear response projector may show spurious small-amplitude, high-frequency oscillations, the equation-of-motion projector emerges as the most promising approach to stationary-state populations.},

The problem of the numerical integration of the equations of motion is considered, and a critical evaluation of the standard fourth-order Runge\textendash Kutta scheme and the symplectic Gauss integrator of variable order are given, including several illustrative numerical experiments. While the Gauss integrator is stable even for laser pulses well above the perturbation limit, our experiments indicate that a system-dependent upper limit exists for the external field strengths. Above this limit, time-dependent coupled-cluster calculations become very challenging numerically, even in the full configuration interaction limit. The source of these numerical instabilities is shown to be rapid increases of the amplitudes as ultrashort high-intensity laser pulses pump the system out of the ground state into states that are virtually orthogonal to the static Hartree-Fock reference determinant.},

  abstract = {Intersystem crossing (ISC), formally forbidden within nonrelativistic quantum theory, is the mechanism by which a molecule changes its spin state. It plays an important role in the excited state decay dynamics of many molecular systems and not just those containing heavy elements. In the simplest case, ISC is driven by direct spin\textendash orbit coupling between two states of different multiplicities. This coupling is usually assumed to remain unchanged by vibrational motion. It is also often presumed that spin-allowed radiationless transitions, i.e. internal conversion, and the nonadiabatic coupling that drives them, can be considered separately from ISC and spin\textendash orbit coupling owing to the vastly different time scales upon which these processes are assumed to occur. However, these assumptions are too restrictive. Indeed, the strong mixing brought about by the simultaneous presence of nonadiabatic and spin\textendash orbit coupling means that often the spin, electronic, and vibrational dynamics cannot be described independently. Instead of considering a simple ladder of states, as depicted in a Jablonski diagram, one must consider the more complicated spin-vibronic levels. Despite the basic ideas being outlined in the 1960s, it is only with the advent of high-level theory and femtosecond spectroscopy that the importance of the spin-vibronic mechanism for ISC in both fundamental as well as applied research fields has been revealed with significant impact across chemistry, physics, and biology. In this review article, we present the theory and fundamental principles of the spin-vibronic mechanism for ISC. This is followed by empirical rules to estimate the rate of ISC within this regime. The most recent developments in experimental techniques, theoretical methods, and models for the spin-vibronic mechanism are discussed. These concepts are subsequently illustrated with examples, including the ISC mechanisms in transition metal complexes, small organic molecules, and organic chromophores.}

  abstract = {Time-dependent electronic structure methods are growing in popularity as tools for modeling ultrafast and/or nonlinear processes, for computing spectra, and as the electronic structure component of mean-field molecular dynamics simulations. Time-dependent configuration interaction (TD-CI) offers several advantages over the widely used real-time time-dependent density functional theory: namely, that it correctly models Rabi oscillations; it offers a spin-pure description of open-shell systems; and a hierarchy of TD-CI methods can be defined that systematically approach the exact solution of the time-dependent Schrodinger equation (TDSE). In this work, we present a novel TD-CI approach that extends TD-CI to large complete active-space configuration expansions. Such extension is enabled by use of a direct configuration interaction approach that eliminates the need to explicitly build, store, or diagonalize the Hamiltonian matrix. Graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration enables fast solution of the TDSE even for large active spacesup to 12 electrons in 12 orbitals (853776 determinants) in this work. A symplectic split operator propagator yields long-time norm conservation. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by computing the response of a large molecule with a strongly correlated ground state, decacene (C42H24), to various pulses ({$\delta$}-function, transform limited, chirped). Our simulations predict that chirped pulses can be used to induce dipole-forbidden transitions. Simulations of decacene using the 631G(d) basis set and a 12 electrons/12 orbitals active space took 20.1 h to propagate for 100 fs with a 1 attosecond time step on a single NVIDIA K40 GPU.

The resulting highly efficient computer codes for the open-shell CR-EOMCC(2,3) approach exploiting the recursively generated intermediates and fast matrix multiplication routines have been developed and interfaced with the GAMESS package, enabling CR-EOMCC(2,3) calculations for singlet as well as nonsinglet ground and excited states of closed- and open-shell systems using the restricted Hartree\textendash Fock or restricted open-shell Hartree\textendash Fock references. A number of important mathematical and algorithmic details related to formal aspects and computer implementation of the CR-EOMCC(2,3) method have been discussed, in addition to overviewing the key concepts behind the CR-EOMCC(2,3) and biorthogonal MMCC methodologies for ground and excited states, and the numerical results involving low-lying states of the CH, CNC, C2N, N3, and NCO species, including states dominated by two-electron transitions, have been presented. The results of the CR-EOMCC(2,3) calculations have been compared with other CC/EOMCC approaches, including the EOMCCSD and EOMCC singles, doubles, and triples methods, and their full and active-space valence counterparts based on the electron-attached and ionized EOMCC methodologies, and the predecessor of CR-EOMCC(2,3) termed CR-EOMCCSD(T) Kowalski and Piecuch, J Chem Phys, 2004, 120, 1715. \textcopyright{} 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This algorithm allows for the extensive use of recurring intermediates and thus provides high computational efficiency. Because of the general formalism employed, overlaps can be computed for varying wave function types, molecular orbitals, basis sets, and molecular geometries. This paves the way for efficiently computing nonadiabatic interaction terms for dynamics simulations. In addition, other application areas can be envisaged, such as the comparison of wave functions constructed at different levels of theory. Aside from explaining the algorithm and evaluating the performance, a detailed analysis of the numerical stability of wave function overlaps is carried out, and strategies for overcoming potential severe pitfalls due to displaced atoms and truncated wave functions are presented.},

Recent advances in inducing point methods have sped up GP marginal likelihood and posterior mean computations, leaving posterior covariance estimation and sampling as the remaining computational bottlenecks. In this paper we address these shortcomings by using the Lanczos algorithm to rapidly approximate the predictive covariance matrix. Our approach, which we refer to as LOVE (LanczOs Variance Estimates), substantially improves time and space complexity. In our experiments, LOVE computes covariances up to 2,000 times faster and draws samples 18,000 times faster than existing methods, all without sacrificing accuracy.},

The 13-dimensional model potential energy surface was obtained from Hartree Fock energies with the 6-31G* basis set and the expectation value of the flux operator along the transition mode was used as a benchmark characteristic. As well as showing excellent convergence of the vMCG method on the model surface using a local harmonic approximation and a moderate number of basis functions, we show that the direct dynamics version of the vMCG also performs very well, usually needs the same number of Gaussians to converge, and converges to exact results if those are obtained on an accurately fitted surface. Finally, we make an important observation that the width of the Gaussian basis functions must be chosen very carefully to obtain accurate results with the use of the frozen-width approximation.}

For H2O, CCSD plus the fourth-order triple excitation correction agrees with the full CI energy to 0.5 kcal/mol.

  abstract = {A first principles quantum formalism to describe the non-adiabatic dynamics of electrons and nuclei based on a second quantization representation (SQR) of the electronic motion combined with the usual representation of the nuclear coordinates is introduced. This procedure circumvents the introduction of potential energy surfaces and non-adiabatic couplings, providing an alternative to the Born\textendash Oppenheimer approximation. An important feature of the molecular Hamiltonian in the mixed first quantized representation for the nuclei and the SQR representation for the electrons is that all degrees of freedom, nuclear positions and electronic occupations, are distinguishable. This makes the approach compatible with various tensor decomposition Ans\"atze for the propagation of the nuclear\textendash electronic wavefunction. Here, we describe the application of this formalism within the multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree framework and its multilayer generalization, corresponding to Tucker and hierarchical Tucker tensor decompositions of the wavefunction, respectively. The approach is applied to the calculation of the photodissociation cross section of the HeH+ molecule under extreme ultraviolet irradiation, which features nonadiabatic effects and quantum interferences between the two possible fragmentation channels, He + H+ and He+ + H. These calculations are compared with the usual description based on ab initio potential energy surfaces and non-adiabatic coupling matrix elements, which fully agree. The proof-of-principle calculations serve to illustrate the advantages and drawbacks of this formalism, which are discussed in detail, as well as possible ways to overcome them. We close with an outlook of possible application domains where the formalism might outperform the usual approach, for example, in situations that combine a strong static correlation of the electrons with non-adiabatic electronic\textendash nuclear effects.},

As for reaction and atomization energies, CCSD(F12*)(T*) is a close approximation to CCSD(F12)(T*) and clearly superior to the other tested approximations. The used scaling for the triples correction enhances the accuracy relative to CCSD(F12*)(T) especially for small basis sets and is very attractive since no additional computational costs are added. However, this scaling slightly breaks size consistency, and therefore we additionally study the accuracy of CCSD(F12*)(T*) and CCSD(F12*)(T) in the context of calculating anharmonic frequencies to check if this causes problems in the generation of the potential energy surface (PES). We find a fast basis set convergence for harmonic and anharmonic frequencies. Already in the cc-pVDZ-F12 basis, the RMSD to the CBS limit is only around 4-5 cm-1.},

We explore different delta-learning schemes which combine electronic structure methods on different levels of theory. Our benchmarks show that for approximate 2-mode potentials the errors can be adjusted to be in the order of 8 cm-1, while for approximate 3-mode and 4-mode potentials the errors fall below 1 cm-1.

The adaptive density guided approach (ADGA) is combined with a machine learning technique, namely, the Gaussian process regression (GPR), in order to obtain the iterative GPR\textendash ADGA for PES construction. The ADGA provides an average density of vibrational states as a physically motivated importance-weighting and an algorithm for choosing points for electronic structure computations employing this information. The GPR provides an approximation to the full PES given a set of data points, while the statistical variance associated with the GPR predictions is used to select the most important among the points suggested by the ADGA. The combination of these two methods, resulting in the GPR\textendash ADGA, can thereby iteratively determine the PES. Our implementation, additionally, allows for incorporating derivative information in the GPR. The iterative process commences from an initial Hessian and does not require any presampling of configurations prior to the PES construction. We assess the performance on the basis of a test set of nine small molecules and fundamental frequencies computed at the full vibrational configuration interaction level. The GPR\textendash ADGA, with appropriate settings, is shown to provide fundamental excitation frequencies of an root mean square deviation (RMSD) below 2 cm-1, when compared to those obtained based on a PES constructed with the standard ADGA.

Furthermore, our implementation does not require the formation and storage of Cholesky vector derivatives. The new implementation is shown to perform well, with less than 10\% of the time spent calculating the gradients in geometry optimizations. Furthermore, the computational time per optimization cycle is significantly lower compared to other implementations based on an inner projection method. We showcase the capabilities of the implementation by optimizing the geometry of the retinal molecule (C20H28O) at the CCSD/aug-cc-pVDZ level of theory.},

Recent applications have shown that for simple molecules, VEOS can provide first-principles thermodynamic property data that are competitive in quality with experiment.

A new energy and gradient calculation is carried out with these non-SCF orbitals to obtain a new Z vector. The process is repeated until the orbitals are optimized (Z = 0), i.e. the contribution to the analytic CC gradient coming from orbital relaxation (CPHF) is zero. At the CCD level the orbitals thus obtained are approximate Brueckner orbitals. At the CCSD level, convergence problems were found in the iterative procedure to optimize the orbitals. Results obtained for several molecules show that CCD wavefunctions constructed from these optimized orbitals are of CCSD quality. We conclude that the presence of exp(t1) in the CCSD model accounts for most relaxation effects and there is not much to gain by orbital optimization in CCSD wavefunctions.},

Among the various X-ray based techniques, near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy, which investigates the energy and probability of resonant core-to-valence transitions, has started to be applied to organic molecules: a recent UV-pump X-ray probe time-resolved NEXAFS experiment [Wolf et al., Nat. Commun., 2017, 8, 1] has shown the capability of the technique to provide information about the ultrafast internal conversion between the bright {$\pi\pi$}* and the dark n{$\pi$}* electronic states of the nucleobase thymine. In the present contribution we introduce an accurate theoretical approach for the simulation of NEXAFS spectra of organic molecules, employing azobenzene as a test case. The electronic structure calculations, which provide both energy levels and transition probabilities of core-to-valence excitations, were here performed with a high level multiconfigurational method, the restricted active space self consistent field (RASSCF/RASPT2). GS- and n{$\pi$}*-NEXAFS spectra were obtained on the top of key molecular geometries (as the optimized cis, trans and conical intersection(s) structures) as well as along the fundamental isomerization coordinates (namely, symmetric and asymmetric bendings of the phenyl rings, and torsion around the central dihedral). We eventually characterize and explain the origin of the simulated signals, highlighting the specific signatures that make it possible to follow the excited state evolution from the n{$\pi$}* Franck\textendash Condon point, towards the conical intersection(s).},

The resulting method, CVS-DFT/MRCI, is validated via the simulation of the K-edge X-ray absorption spectra of 40 organic chromophores, amino acids, and nucleobases, ranging in size from CO2 to tryptophan. Overall, the CVS-DFT/MRCI method is found to yield accurate X-ray absorption spectra (XAS), with consistent errors in peak positions of {$\sim$}2.5\textendash 3.5 eV. Additionally, we show that the CVS-DFT/MRCI method may be employed to simulate XAS from valence excited states and compare the simulated spectra to those computed using the established wave function-based approaches [ADC(2) and ADC(2)x]. In general, each of the methods yields excited state XAS spectra in qualitative and often quantitative agreement. In the instances where the methods differ, the CVS-DFT/MRCI simulations predict intensity for transitions for which the underlying electronic states are characterized by doubly excited configurations relative to the ground state configuration. Here, we aim to demonstrate that the CVS-DFT/MRCI approach occupies a specific niche among numerous other electronic structure methods in this area, offering the ability to treat initial states of arbitrary electronic character while maintaining a low computational cost and comparatively black box usage.}

Although this certainly provides a useful tool in facilitating the description of the system, its applications to systems consisting of more than one particle are problematic. This is due to the fact that all information about the system is lost upon the absorption of one particle; a formalism based solely on the Schro\textasciidieresis dinger equation is not able to describe the remainder of the system as particles are lost. Here we demonstrate how the dynamics of a quantum system with a given number of identical fermions may be described in a manner which allows for particle loss. A consistent formalism which incorporates the evolution of sub-systems with a reduced number of particles is constructed through the Lindblad equation. Specifically, the transition from an N-particle system to an (N - 1)-particle system due to a complex absorbing potential is achieved by relating the Lindblad operators to annihilation operators. The method allows for a straight forward interpretation of how many constituent particles have left the system after interaction. We illustrate the formalism using one-dimensional two-particle model problems.},

  abstract = {First-order nonadiabatic coupling matrix elements (NACMEs) are key for phenomena such as nonradiative transitions and excited-state decay, yet a consistent and practical first principles treatment has been elusive for molecules with more than a few heavy atoms. Here we present theory, implementation using Gaussian basis sets, and benchmarks of first-order NACMEs between ground and excited states in the framework of time-dependent hybrid density functional theory (TDDFT). A time-dependent response approach to NACMEs which avoids explicit computation of excited-state wave functions is outlined. In contrast to previous approaches, the present treatment produces exact analytical derivative couplings between time-dependent Kohn\textendash Sham (TDKS) determinants in a finite atom-centered basis set. As in analytical gradient theory, derivative molecular orbital coefficients can be eliminated, making the computational cost independent of the number of nuclear degrees of freedom. Our expression reduces to the exact Chernyak\textendash Mukamel formula for first-order NACMEs in the complete basis-set limit, but greatly improves basis-set convergence in finite atom-centered basis sets due to additional Pulay type terms. The Chernyak\textendash Mukamel formula is shown to be equivalent to the Hellmann\textendash Feynman contribution in analytical gradient theory. Our formalism may be implemented in TDDFT analytical excited-state gradient codes with minor modifications. Tests for systems with up to 147 atoms show that evaluation of first-order NACMEs causes total computation times to increase by an insignificant 10\% on average. The resolution-of-the-identity approximation for the Coulomb energy (RI-J)(RI-J){$<$}math display="inline" overflow="scroll" altimg="eq-00001.gif"{$><$}mrow{$><$}mrow{$><$}mo{$>$}({$<$}/mo{$><$}mrow{$><$}mtext{$>$}RI-{$<$}/mtext{$><$}mi{$>$}J{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mo{$>$}){$<$}/mo{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$} reduces the computational cost by an order of magnitude for nonhybrid functionals, while errors are insignificant with standard auxiliary basis sets. We compare the computed NACMEs to full configuration interaction (FCI) in benchmark results for diatomic molecules; hybrid TDDFT and FCI are found to be in agreement for regions of the potential energy curve where the Kohn\textendash Sham ground-state reference is stable and the character of the excitation is properly captured by the present functionals. With these developments, nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations of molecular systems in the 100 atoms regime are within reach.}

  abstract = {Controlling the distribution of electrons in materials is the holy grail of chemistry and material science. Practical attempts at this feat are common but are often reliant on simplistic arguments based on electronegativity. One challenge is knowing when such arguments work, and which other factors may play a role. Ultimately, electrons move to equalize chemical potentials. In this work, we outline a theory in which chemical potentials of atoms and molecules are expressed in terms of reinterpretations of common chemical concepts and some physical quantities: electronegativity, chemical hardness, and the sensitivity of electronic repulsion and core levels with respect to changes in the electron density. At the zero-temperature limit, an expression of the Fermi level emerges that helps to connect several of these quantities to a plethora of material properties, theories and phenomena predominantly explored in condensed matter physics. Our theory runs counter to Sanderson's postulate of electronegativity equalization and allows a perspective in which electronegativities of bonded atoms need not be equal. As chemical potentials equalize in this framework, electronegativities equilibrate.},

  abstract = {Quantitative simulations of electronically nonadiabatic molecular processes require both accurate dynamics algorithms and accurate electronic structure information. Direct semiclassical nonadiabatic dynamics is expensive due to the high cost of electronic structure calculations, and hence it is limited to small systems, limited ensemble averaging, ultrafast processes, and/or electronic structure methods that are only semiquantitatively accurate. The cost of dynamics calculations can be made manageable if analytic fits are made to the electronic structure data, and such fits are most conveniently carried out in a diabatic representation because the surfaces are smooth and the couplings between states are smooth scalar functions. Diabatic representations, unlike the adiabatic ones produced by most electronic structure methods, are not unique, and finding suitable diabatic representations often involves time-consuming nonsystematic diabatization steps. The biggest drawback of using diabatic bases is that it can require large amounts of effort to perform a globally consistent diabatization, and one of our goals has been to develop methods to do this efficiently and automatically. In this Feature Article, we introduce the mathematical framework of diabatic representations, and we discuss diabatization methods, including adiabatic-to-diabatic transformations and recent progress toward the goal of automatization.},

  abstract = {The Coupled Cluster (CC) method is used to compute the electronic correlation energy in atoms and molecules and often leads to highly accurate results. However, due to its single-reference nature, standard CC in its projected form fails to describe quantum states characterized by strong electronic correlations and multi-reference projective methods become necessary. On the other hand, quantum algorithms for the solution of many-electron problems have also emerged recently. The quantum unitary variant of CC (UCC) with singles and doubles (q-UCCSD) is a popular wavefunction Ansatz for the variational quantum eigensolver algorithm. The variational nature of this approach can lead to significant advantages compared to its classical equivalent in the projected form, in particular, for the description of strong electronic correlation. However, due to the large number of gate operations required in q-UCCSD, approximations need to be introduced in order to make this approach implementable in a state-of-the-art quantum computer. In this work, we evaluate several variants of the standard q-UCCSD Ansatz in which only a subset of excitations is included. In particular, we investigate the singlet and pair q-UCCD approaches combined with orbital optimization. We show that these approaches can capture the dissociation/distortion profiles of challenging systems, such as H4, H2O, and N2 molecules, as well as the one-dimensional periodic Fermi\textendash Hubbard chain. These results promote the future use of q-UCC methods for the solution of challenging electronic structure problems in quantum chemistry.},

This basis is constructed from a set of reference states via real-time evolution; thus, avoiding the numerical optimization of parameters. An efficient algorithm for the evaluation of the off-diagonal matrix elements of the overlap and Hamiltonian matrices is discussed and a selection procedure is introduced to identify a basis of orthogonal references that ameliorates the linear dependency problem.

At least for the cases considered here [NO3(2A{${'}$}2), N2(2{$\Sigma$}g+) and NO2(2B2)], the Brueckner reference function, which by definition does not mix with single excitations in the CC wave function, preserves symmetry exactly. Furthermore, these solutions do not appear to be sensitive to the initial guess, as the same symmetric solutions are obtained starting with either symmetry-broken or symmetry-constrained initial guesses. The same behavior is not observed for Brueckner determinants obtained from configuration interaction calculations, where symmetry-broken solutions are found. An evaluation of the merits of basing CC calculations on Brueckner determinants [B\textendash CC] and quasirestricted Hartree\textendash Fock [QRHF] reference functions (which also can be chosen to preserve symmetry exactly) is presented. Calculations carried out on the NO3 radical predict a C2v equilibrium geometry at both the B\textendash CC and QRHF\textendash CC levels when triple excitations are not included. However, all methods which include an approximate treatment of triple excitation effects predict an extremely flat potential surface which slightly favors the symmetric [D3h] form of the molecule.},

This approach is a reformulation of the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (BHF) method used in nuclear physics and known also as the exact SCF method. We discuss the use of the reference-state determinants built of HF, natural, and Brueckner spin orbitals, with relations among them investigated in terms of the many-body perturbation theory (MBPT). It is shown that the Brueckner spin orbitals emerge as a convenient basis set in the coupledcluster method and equations that determine these spin orbitals are found. The Brueckner spin orbitals can be calculated as eigenvectors of a certain Hermitian one-electron operator which has a form of the Hartree-Fock operator plus a ``correlation potential'' depending linearly on two- and threeelectron cluster amplitudes. The usual decoupling scheme in the coupled-cluster method leads to a hierarchy of approximations; in the first nontrivial one the three-electron cluster amplitudes are neglected, and the two-electron ones are determined by solving Ciiek's CPMET equations. We also analyze the problem of spatial, spin, and time-reversal symmetry in the CC and BHF methods. If (and only if) the reference-state determinant belongs to a one-dimensional representation of a certain symmetry subgroup of the system, the CC operator and the BHF one-electron operator are invariant with respect to this subgroup. Thus the restricted (entirely symmetry-adapted) version of the BHF method can be formulated only for the closed-shell systems. This is done for the above-mentioned approximate BHF method. We discuss also the usefulness of the BHF method in application to extended metallic systems.},

The regime of rate enhancement, the observed sharp resonances at varying cavity frequencies, and the survival of these effects in the collective regime remain mostly unexplained. In this paper, we consider the \textbackslash emph\{cis\}-\textbackslash emph\{trans\} isomerization of HONO atomistically using an \textbackslash emph\{ab-initio\} potential energy surface. We evaluate the transmission coefficient using the reactive flux method and identify the conditions for rate acceleration. In the underdamped, low-friction regime of the reaction coordinate, the cavity coupling enhances the rate with increasing coupling strength until reaching the Kramers turnover point. Sharp resonances in this regime are related to cavity-enabled energy redistribution channels.},

  abstract = {Automatic differentiation (AD) is a powerful tool that allows calculating derivatives of implemented algorithms with respect to all of their parameters up to machine precision, without the need to explicitly add any additional functions. Thus, AD has great potential in quantum chemistry, where gradients are omnipresent but also difficult to obtain, and researchers typically spend a considerable amount of time finding suitable analytical forms when implementing derivatives. Here, we demonstrate that AD can be used to compute gradients with respect to any parameter throughout a complete quantum chemistry method. We present Dif f iQult, a Hartree-Fock implementation, entirely differentiated with the use of AD tools. Diff iQult is a software package written in plain Python with minimal deviation from standard code which illustrates the capability of AD to save human effort and time in implementations of exact gradients in quantum chemistry. We leverage the obtained gradients to optimize the parameters of one-particle basis sets in the context of the floating Gaussian framework.},

  abstract = {Explicit symplectic integrators have been important tools for accurate and efficient approximations of mechanical systems with separable Hamiltonians. For the first time, the article proposes for arbitrary Hamiltonians similar integrators, which are explicit, of any even order, symplectic in an extended phase space, and with pleasant long time properties. They are based on a mechanical restraint that binds two copies of phase space together. Using backward error analysis, KAM theory, and additional multiscale analysis, an error bound of \$\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(T\textbackslash delta\^l \textbackslash omega)\$ is established for integrable systems, where \$T\$, \$\textbackslash delta\$, \$l\$ and \$\textbackslash omega\$ are respectively the (long) simulation time, step size, integrator order, and some binding constant. For non-integrable systems with positive Lyapunov exponents, such an error bound is generally impossible, but satisfactory statistical behaviors were observed in a numerical experiment with a nonlinear Schr\textbackslash "\{o\}dinger equation.},

A novel approach, Brueckner coupled-cluster doubles with perturbative triples BCCD(T)(F12*) is presented that avoids the expensive re-evaluation of F12 integrals throughout the orbital optimisation and includes a newly derived basis set correction to the Brueckner reference energy. The generalisation of F12 theory to arbitrary non-Hartree\textendash Fock references and to Fock operators that include scalar relativistic effects is also presented. The performance of the new Brueckner F12 method is assessed for a test set of 50 open- and closed-shell reactions and for the ionisation potentials and electron affinities (EAs) of the first-row transition metal atoms. Benchmark basis set limit coupled-cluster singles, doubles and perturbative triples (CCSD(T)) and BCCD(T) values are reported for all energies in the test sets. BCCD(T)(F12*) performs systematically better than CCSD(T)(F12*) for electron affinities where orbital relaxation effects are significant.},

  abstract = {Shaking up reaction-site selectivity                            It seems intuitive that putting vibrational energy into a chemical bond ought to promote selective cleavage of that bond. In fact, the relation of vibrational excitation to reactivity has generally proven subtler and more complex. Thomas               et al.               studied how strong coupling of specific vibrational modes to an optical cavity might influence a molecule with two competing reactive sites. The molecule had two silicon centers that could react with fluoride by respective cleavage of a Si\textendash C or Si\textendash O bond. Exciting the vibrations at either center slowed down the overall reaction while favoring otherwise disfavored Si\textendash O cleavage.                                         Science               , this issue p.               615                        ,              Strong coupling of vibrational modes to an optical cavity shifts site-selectivity in competing silyl substitution reactions.           ,              Many chemical methods have been developed to favor a particular product in transformations of compounds that have two or more reactive sites. We explored a different approach to site selectivity using vibrational strong coupling (VSC) between a reactant and the vacuum field of a microfluidic optical cavity. Specifically, we studied the reactivity of a compound bearing two possible silyl bond cleavage sites\textemdash Si\textendash C and Si\textendash O, respectively\textemdash as a function of VSC of three distinct vibrational modes in the dark. The results show that VSC can indeed tilt the reactivity landscape to favor one product over the other. Thermodynamic parameters reveal the presence of a large activation barrier and substantial changes to the activation entropy, confirming the modified chemical landscape under strong coupling.},

Our simulations illustrate how the branching between nonradiative intersystem crossing and radiative decay through the cavity can be tuned by selecting specific cavity photon energies resonant at specific molecular geometries.

We investigate here how collective coupling effects lead to modifications of the mechanisms and rates of photochemical processes, in particular, photodissociation and nonradiative decay in NaI and pyrazine, respectively. We show that, after direct excitation into the lower polaritonic states, the lower-energy light-matter hybrid states, the dynamics of the molecular ensemble coupled to light is very similar to the dynamics of the corresponding isolated molecules. Conversely, excitation into the upper polaritonic states results in more complex dynamics that involve as a first step the population transfer toward the manifold of intermediate dark states. These dynamics differ substantially from those of the isolated molecules and may result in measurable time delays for nonradiative decay or excited-state reaction mechanisms. Similarly, we describe how addition of a buffer of nonreactive molecules coupled to the cavity mode can be used to delay the onset of the photochemical processes of the reactive part of the ensemble, where the buffer medium is more effective in inhibiting the reactive process than only reactive molecules in the cavity.},

The ionization potential (IP) variant of fc-CVS-EOM-CCSD, in which the EOM target states have one electron less than the reference, gives access to core-ionized states thus enabling modeling of X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) and its time-resolved variant (TR-XPS). Dyson orbitals are reduced quantities that can be interpreted as correlated states of the ejected/attached electron; they enter the expressions of various experimentally relevant quantities. In the context of photoelectron spectroscopy, Dyson orbitals can be used to estimate the strengths of photoionization transitions. We illustrate the utility of Dyson orbitals and fc-CVS-EOM-IP-CCSD by calculating XPS of the ground state of adenine and TR-XPS of the excited states of uracil.},

Calculations have been performed with a double-zeta plus polarization basis set on the HzO, SiHz, NH2, BeO, Cz, CN+, and BN molecules. Calculationson HzO and SiHzat equilibrium and stretched geometries show negligible differencebetween HF- and B-cCSDT energies. This is also true for NHz,except when the bonds have been stretched to twice their equilibrium values, at which point there is about a 2.5 milli-Hartree (mEh)difference. Calculations on the isoelectronic systems BeO, C2, CN', and BN were performed at equilibrium geometries. Even though these systems have large T Iamplitudes, the difference between HF- and B-CCSDTenergies is only about 1 mEh. For the CCSD method and the CCSD(T) method, which includes triple excitations in an approximate, noniterative manner, however, somewhat larger differences are observed between and HFand B-CCresults. Finally, some properties of BN were computed using HF- and B-CC methods. There are quite small differences between the HF- and B-CCSDT results, but significantly larger ones for the more approximate CCSD and CCSD(T) methods. For this difficult system, where the CCSD(T) approximation seems to be inadequate for HF orbitals, the use of Brueckner orbitals improves the agreement Of CCSD(T) with CCSD(T) substantially for r, and we, although the difference for p is unaffected. 0 1994 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

To describe these energetically high-lying excited states theoretically, we have implemented a variant of the algebraic-diagrammatic construction scheme of second-order ADC(2) by applying the core-valence separation (CVS) approximation to the ADC(2) working equations. Besides excitation energies, the CVS-ADC(2) method also provides access to properties of core-excited states, thereby allowing for the calculation of X-ray absorption spectra. To demonstrate the potential of our implementation of CVS-ADC(2), we have chosen medium-sized molecules as examples that have either biological importance or find application in organic electronics. The calculated results of CVS-ADC(2) are compared with standard TD-DFT/B3LYP values and experimental data. In particular, the extended variant, CVS-ADC(2)-x, provides the most accurate results, and the agreement between the calculated values and experiment is remarkable. \textcopyright{} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {Variational quantum algorithms are ubiquitous in applications of noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers. Due to the structure of conventional parametrized quantum gates, the evaluated functions typically are finite Fourier series of the input parameters. In this work, we use this fact to derive new, general parameter-shift rules for single-parameter gates, and provide closed-form expressions to apply them. These rules are then extended to multi-parameter quantum gates by combining them with the stochastic parameter-shift rule. We perform a systematic analysis of quantum resource requirements for each rule, and show that a reduction in resources is possible for higher-order derivatives. Using the example of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm, we show that the generalized parameter-shift rule can reduce the number of circuit evaluations significantly when computing derivatives with respect to parameters that feed into many gates. Our approach additionally reproduces reconstructions of the evaluated function up to a chosen order, leading to known generalizations of the Rotosolve optimizer and new extensions of the quantum analytic descent optimization algorithm.},

  abstract = {It has been well-established that the topography around conical intersections between excited electronic states is incorrectly described by coupled cluster and many other single reference theories (the intersections are ``defective''). Despite this, we show both analytically and numerically that the geometric phase effect (GPE) is correctly reproduced upon traversing a path around a defective excited-state conical intersection (CI) in coupled cluster theory. The theoretical analysis is carried out by using a non-Hermitian generalization of the linear vibronic coupling approach. Interestingly, the approach qualitatively explains the characteristic (incorrect) shape of the defective CIs and CI seams. Moreover, the validity of the approach and the presence of the GPE indicate that defective CIs are local (and not global) artifacts. This implies that a sufficiently accurate coupled cluster method could predict nuclear dynamics, including geometric phase effects, as long as the nuclear wavepacket never gets too close to the conical intersections.},

Organic molecules with heteroatoms often possess an important excited-state relaxation channel from an optically allowed {$\pi\pi$}* to a dark n{$\pi$}* state. The {$\pi\pi$}*/n{$\pi$}* internal conversion is difficult to investigate, as most spectroscopic methods are not exclusively sensitive to changes in the excited-state electronic structure. Here, we report achieving the required sensitivity by exploiting the element and site specificity of near-edge soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy. As a hole forms in the n orbital during {$\pi\pi$}*/n{$\pi$}* internal conversion, the absorption spectrum at the heteroatom K-edge exhibits an additional resonance. We demonstrate the concept using the nucleobase thymine at the oxygen K-edge, and unambiguously show that {$\pi\pi$}*/n{$\pi$}* internal conversion takes place within (60\,{$\pm$}\,30) fs. High-level-coupled cluster calculations confirm the method's impressive electronic structure sensitivity for excited-state investigations.},

Based on the efficient multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree wavepacket propagation algorithm, it can treat part, or all, of the wavepacket using Gaussian functions. The Gaussian parameters evolve using variational, coupled equations of motion. In this way the Gaussian basis functions evolve so as to optimally describe the wavepacket. Here, a four-dimensional Henon\textendash Heiles potential surface is used to demonstrate that only a few Gaussian functions are required, and convergence on the full quantum mechanical result is rapid.},

The investigation employed basis sets up to triple-{$\zeta$} plus double polarization plus f functions (TZ2Pf) and levels of correlation up to coupled-cluster including single, double, and perturbatively treated connected triple excitations [CCSD(T)]. The HOOH+ cation, which is planar, has both trans (C2h) and cis (C2v) conformations, the former predicted to be 8 kcal\,mol-1 lower in energy. At the highest level of theory, the distonic H2OO+ structure is found to lie 23 kcal\,mol-1 above the conventional trans form. The barrier separating the oxywater cation from HOOH+ is about 33 kcal\,mol-1, roughly ten times larger than that for the neutral oxywater species. Accordingly, ionization greatly enhances the stability of the nonconventional oxywater structure. Harmonic vibrational frequencies and their infrared intensities are also reported for the H2O+2 species. Symmetry breaking of Hartree\textendash Fock electronic wave functions is found in HOOH+, which adversely affects certain vibrational frequencies due to nearby singularities in related quadratic force constants. This problem is efficaciously overcome via Brueckner methods [BD and BD(T)].},

Rev. B 104, 035121 (2021) and Sekaran et al., Computation 10, 45 (2022)]. In this work, we present an extension of this approach to the more general case of multi-orbital fragments using the block version of the Householder transformation applied to the one-body reduced density matrix, unlocking the applicability to general quantum chemistry/condensed matter physics Hamiltonians. A step-by-step construction of the block Householder transformation is presented. Both physical and numerical areas of interest of the approach are highlighted. The specific mean-field (noninteracting) case is thoroughly detailed as it is shown that the embedding of a given N spin\textendash orbital fragment leads to the generation of two separated sub-systems: (1) a 2N spin\textendash orbitals ``fragment+bath'' cluster that exactly contains N electrons and (2) a remaining cluster's ``environment'' described by so-called core electrons. We illustrate the use of this transformation in different cases of embedding scheme for practical applications. We particularly focus on the extension of the previously introduced Local Potential Functional Embedding Theory and Householder-transformed Density Matrix Functional Embedding Theory to the case of multi-orbital fragments. These calculations are realized on different types of systems, such as model Hamiltonians (Hubbard rings) and ab initio molecular systems (hydrogen rings).},

  abstract = {X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) and table-top sources of x-rays based upon high harmonic generation (HHG) have revolutionized the field of ultrafast x-ray atomic and molecular physics, largely due to an explosive growth in capabilities in the past decade. XFELs now provide unprecedented intensity (1020 W cm-2) of x-rays at wavelengths down to {$\sim$}1 \AA ngstrom, and HHG provides unprecedented time resolution ({$\sim$}50 attoseconds) and a correspondingly large coherent bandwidth at longer wavelengths. For context, timescales can be referenced to the Bohr orbital period in hydrogen atom of 150 attoseconds and the hydrogen-molecule vibrational period of 8 femtoseconds; wavelength scales can be referenced to the chemically significant carbon K-edge at a photon energy of {$\sim$}280 eV (44 \AA ngstroms) and the bond length in methane of {$\sim$}1 \AA ngstrom. With these modern x-ray sources one now has the ability to focus on individual atoms, even when embedded in a complex molecule, and view electronic and nuclear motion on their intrinsic scales (attoseconds and \AA ngstroms). These sources have enabled coherent diffractive imaging, where one can image non-crystalline objects in three dimensions on ultrafast timescales, potentially with atomic resolution. The unprecedented intensity available with XFELs has opened new fields of multiphoton and nonlinear x-ray physics where behavior of matter under extreme conditions can be explored. The unprecedented time resolution and pulse synchronization provided by HHG sources has kindled fundamental investigations of time delays in photoionization, charge migration in molecules, and dynamics near conical intersections that are foundational to AMO physics and chemistry. This roadmap coincides with the year when three new XFEL facilities, operating at \AA ngstrom wavelengths, opened for users (European XFEL, Swiss-FEL and PAL-FEL in Korea) almost doubling the present worldwide number of XFELs, and documents the remarkable progress in HHG capabilities since its discovery roughly 30 years ago, showcasing experiments in AMO physics and other applications. Here we capture the perspectives of 17 leading groups and organize the contributions into four categories: ultrafast molecular dynamics, multidimensional x-ray spectroscopies; high-intensity x-ray phenomena; attosecond x-ray science.},

Our algorithm is closely related to the CIS analytic energy gradient algorithm and should be straightforward to implement in any quantum chemistry code that has CIS analytic energy gradients. The additional cost of evaluating the derivative couplings is small in comparison to the cost of evaluating the gradients for the two electronic states in question. Incorporation of an exchange-correlation term provides an ad hoc extension of this formalism to time-dependent density functional theory within the Tamm-Dancoff approximation, without the need to invoke quadratic response theory or evaluate third derivatives of the exchange-correlation functional. Application to several different conical intersections in ethylene demonstrates that minimum-energy crossing points along conical seams can be located at substantially reduced cost when analytic derivative couplings are employed, as compared to use of a branching-plane updating algorithm that does not require these couplings. Application to H3 near its D3h geometry demonstrates that correct topology is obtained in the vicinity of a conical intersection involving a degenerate ground state.}

Matrix elements for SA-SF-CIS are then modified in a manner similar to collinear spin-flip time-dependent density functional theory (SF-TDDFT), to include a DFT exchange-correlation correction. The performance of this method, which we call SA-SF-DFT, is evaluated numerically and we find that it systematically improves the energies of electronic states that exhibit significant spin contamination within the conventional SF-TDDFT approach. The new method cures the state assignment problem that plagues geometry optimizations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations using traditional SF-TDDFT, without sacrificing computational efficiency, and furthermore provides correct topology at conical intersections, including those that involve the ground state, unlike conventional TDDFT. As such, SA-SF-DFT appears to be a promising method for generating excited-state potential energy surfaces at DFT cost.}
